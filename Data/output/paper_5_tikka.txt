Fact Sheet

IQVIA Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) Data Factory 
Deliver comprehensive, systematic value from textual data    
across your business
The importance of data in driving clinical and commercial 
outcomes is absolute, yet many life science and 
healthcare organizations leave 80 percent of potential 
insights untapped, locked away in unstructured and semi 
structured formats. Manual abstraction of these vast 
amounts of data is time-consuming and unsustainable, 
and niche point solutions can’t extract and integrate 
information across multiple business areas. 

The IQVIA NLP Data Factory accurately surfaces 
and normalizes features of interest at scale, in an 
automated, robust and easily configurable pipeline. 
Transform efficiency and productivity across the 
enterprise with reproducible extraction, enrichment 
and delivery of critical data. 

• Enterprise data warehouse

• Predictive analytics

• Monitoring and alerts

• Knowledge graph

• BI platforms
      e.g. NLP Insights Hub

XML, JSON, 
SQL, CSV, ....

Highly scalable to 
10 million+ documents 

per hour

YOUR CHALLENGES

• Missing important information hidden in vast 
amounts of unstructured and semi structured text

• Staff spend huge amounts of time and expense on 
manual data curation – including inconsistencies in 
structured data where the same data is recorded in 
many ways

• Expensive point solutions are narrow in scope and 
lack critical domain knowledge

• Lacking the tools to transform and prepare data for 
analysis and use at scale

YOUR NLP DATA FACTORY SOLUTION

• Mobilizes value at scale from the key data your 
organization has generated or invested in 

• Automates NLP workflows which process millions of 
documents and data fields across a range of business 
lines, normalizing data and enhancing metadata for 
easy consumption

• Easily and efficiently scales to add new use cases to 
the robust NLP Data Factory pipeline

• Delivers ready-to-use data and solutions that improve 
business outcomes

NLP DATA FACTORY KEY FEATURES

• Effective robust solution for extracting value from 
textual data - think of it as intelligent ETL (Extract 
-Transform-Load) of free text. 

• World-class NLP to surface and transform data     
from a wide range of formats to common data 
standards outputs

• Integrated OCR to ensure scanned text is not           
left behind

• Embeds seamlessly into existing enterprise 
architectures and workflows

• Deployable on-premise, in cloud environments or 
with a hybrid implementation 

• Recognizes and normalizes complex constructs such 
as cancer staging

• Seamlessly incorporates trained ML models

TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

Industry-proven NLP technology. The NLP Data 
Factory uses IQVIA NLP technologies to power the 
normalization and standardization of input data. 
This blend of methods combines rule-based queries, 
machine learning, terminology matching, pattern 
extraction and relationship identification to ensure the 
highest possible accuracy for the task in hand.

Fast, scalable, architecture. The components required 
to power the NLP Data Factory has been developed 
together to optimize the efficiency of the system. 
An internal orchestration component is designed to 
parallelize incoming data, ensuring that scaling is 
effective and matches the availability of resources.

Flexible NLP framework. The flexible nature of the 
IQVIA NLP query engines ensures that new modules 
can be dropped into the NLP Data Factory with no 
effort. These modules can be used right away or can be 
tuned further using a powerful browser-based query 
editing tool.

Easy deployment via Kubernetes. Components in the 
system are containerized for simpler management. 
Furthermore the full system is deployed using 
Kubernetes or equivalent, allowing for simpler 
installation, easier service monitoring and automated 
scaling of the system.
