6,9 Best practices to successfully implement AI within an organization 11 Pitfalls of AI implementation 14 Summary 15 IBM Services 18 About the authors 18 Acknowledgements 18 Appendix Introduction To implement AI within your organization successfully you need to understand what AI is where it currently stands what value can provide to businesses and how it can be successfully adopted,5,3,1,TRAIN
7,This white paper is written for business leaders looking for practical advice on how to leverage artificial intelligence AI for their organizations,5,2,1,TRAIN
8,The fact that AI has been hyped doesn’t take away from its capabilities as a real value driver,3,2,1,TRAIN
9,Heavy investments have been made in AI across multiple industries the Chinese government even made it one of their core sectors,2,1,1,TRAIN
10,And companies like IBM Microsoft Google and Amazon are leading the pack when it comes to utilizing data and AI,1,2,1,TRAIN
11,AI provides enormous amounts of value in multiple industries,2,1,1,TRAIN
12,Because of its high value potential many companies have been scrambling to implement AI within their organizations,2,1,1,TRAIN
13,And the projects when implemented properly have shown significant returns and improved competitive edge,1,3,1,TRAIN
14,If your company hasn’t started implementing AI it may lag behind its competitors so it’s critical to evaluate what AI can do for your organization,4,2,1,TRAIN
15,But this doesn’t mean you should hire data scientists or acquiring data science solutions without a clear strategy,4,1,1,TRAIN
16,Implementing AI should be a carefully thought out process,1,2,1,TRAIN
17,Otherwise it may turn out to be a costly failure,1,1,1,TRAIN
18,The authors of this paper want to provide you with the knowledge you need to evaluate what type of AI solutions you can implement to give your company a competitive advantage,6,3,1,TRAIN
19,IBM Services 3 What is AI,0,1,0,TRAIN
20,When people hear AI they often think about sentient robots and magic boxes,0,2,0,TRAIN
21,AI today is much more mundane and simple—but that doesn’t mean it’s not powerful,4,0,0,TRAIN
22,Another misconception is that high profile research projects can be applied directly to any business situation,4,1,1,TRAIN
23,AI done right can create extreme return on investments ROIs —for instance through automation or precise prediction,6,2,1,TRAIN
24,But it does take thought time and proper implementation,3,1,1,TRAIN
25,We have seen that success and value generated by AI projects is increased when there is a grounded understanding and expectation of what the technology can deliver from the C suite down,4,3,1,TRAIN
26,We are now at the brink of the fourth Industrial Revolution,1,0,0,TRAIN
27,AI is one of the biggest facets of this revolution and it will affect almost all sectors as did previous Industrial Revolutions 1 AI’s abilities have increased significantly since its inception in 1955 it can now detect patterns more accurately continuously and based on more data,2,3,1,TRAIN
28,Currently AI has surpassed human intelligence in some specific domains,1,1,1,TRAIN
29,These domains can be split in three categories general tasks formal tasks and expert tasks,0,1,0,TRAIN
30,General tasks could include visual recognition speech recognition natural language processing and translation,6,1,1,TRAIN
31,Formal tasks are related to games where some theorem and learning is involved,0,2,0,TRAIN
32,And expert tasks are those that would otherwise be executed by a domain expert,2,1,1,TRAIN
33,Think of tasks such as diagnosing disease and engineering 2 As already stated AI was first named in 1955 and was defined as the ability of machines to perform human like tasks,1,3,1,TRAIN
34,The term has gained popularity ever since its first mention,3,1,1,TRAIN
35,However there is still quite a bit of confusion about the difference between AI machine learning and deep learning—but simply stated AI encompasses the latter two,4,3,1,TRAIN
36,AI Artificial intelligence A program that can sense reason act and adapt,6,0,0,TRAIN
37,Machine learning Algorithms whose performance improve as they are exposed to more data over time,4,2,1,TRAIN
38,Deep learning Subset of machine learning in which multipayered neutral networks learn from vast amount of data,3,2,1,TRAIN
39,Figure 1 The distinction between AI Machine Learning and Deep Learning,2,0,0,TRAIN
40,“Artificial Intelligence AI is a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use their nervous systems and bodies to sense learn reason and take action ”3 Lately there has been a big rise in the day to day use of machines powered by AI,8,5,1,TRAIN
41,These machines are wired using cross disciplinary approaches based on mathematics computer science statistics psychology and more 4 Virtual assistants are becoming more common most of the web shops predict your purchases many companies make use of chatbots in their customer service and many companies use algorithms to detect fraud,7,6,1,TRAIN
42,These are just a few of the examples of how AI is used every day,1,1,1,TRAIN
43,4 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business Machine learning Machine learning is enabling a machine to learn from data without explicitly programming it with rules because it can learn from the data it’s given,7,6,1,TRAIN
44,In essence you could build an AI consisting of many different rules and it would also be able to be AI,1,2,1,TRAIN
45,But instead of programming all the rules you feed the algorithm data and let the algorithm adjust itself to improve the accuracy of the algorithm,4,3,1,TRAIN
46,Traditional science algorithms mainly process whereas machine learning is about applying an algorithm to fit a model to the data,5,1,1,TRAIN
47,Examples of machine learning algorithms that are used a lot and that you might be familiar with are decision trees random forest Bayesian networks K mean clustering neural networks regression artificial neural networks deep learning and reinforcement learning,7,1,1,TRAIN
48,Artificial neural networks and deep learning have recently become more common machine learning algorithms,1,3,1,TRAIN
49,Implementation examples would be predicting stock market prices or predicting whether a customer will churn from your company,6,1,1,TRAIN
50,Deep learning Deep learning DL is a relatively new set of methods that is changing machine learning in fundamental ways,2,3,1,TRAIN
51,DL isn’t an algorithm per se but rather a family of algorithms that implements deep networks many layers,2,0,0,TRAIN
52,These networks are so deep that new methods of computation such as graphics processing units GPUs are required to train them in addition to clusters of compute nodes,3,4,1,TRAIN
53,DL works very well with large amounts data and whenever a problem is too complex to understand and engineer features due to unstructured data for instance,3,1,1,TRAIN
54,DL almost always outperforms the other types of algorithms when it comes to image classification natural language processing and speech recognition,6,2,1,TRAIN
55,An example would be recognizing melanoma or conducting machine translation which was not possible using previous techniques,4,3,1,TRAIN
56,Figure 2 Deep neural network with five layers 5 Currently the larger the neural network and the more data that can be added to it the better the performance a neural network can provide,6,1,1,TRAIN
57,DL is very powerful but it has a couple of drawbacks,0,0,0,TRAIN
58,It’s almost impossible to determine why the system came to a certain conclusion,3,1,1,TRAIN
59,This is called the “black box” problem though there are now many available techniques that can increase insights in the inner workings of the DL model,4,2,1,TRAIN
60,Also deep learning often requires extensive training times a lot of data and specific hardware requirements and it’s not easy to acquire the specific skills needed to develop a new DL solution to a problem,7,3,1,TRAIN
61,In conclusion there is no one algorithm that can fit or solve all problems,4,0,0,TRAIN
62,Success really depends on the problem you need to solve and the data you have available,2,2,1,TRAIN
63,Sometimes a problem will need a hybrid approach where you use multiple algorithms to solve the problem,3,2,1,TRAIN
64,Each problem requires extensive investigation of what constitutes a best fit type of algorithm,4,2,1,TRAIN
65,You should take into account transparency and how much data capabilities and time you have because some algorithms take a long time to run,5,1,1,TRAIN
66,Input layer Hidden layer 1 Hidden layer 2 Hidden layer 3 Output layer IBM Services 5 How does an AI system learn,3,2,1,TRAIN
67,To illustrate how AI system learning works we’ll next describe what a data scientist does and what a machine does in the process of developing AI solutions,6,2,1,TRAIN
68,Later when we discuss the pitfalls of implementing AI we’ll explain what types of skills you’ll need to successfully build a data science team,2,6,1,TRAIN
69,Data scientist The data scientist extracts knowledge and interprets data by using the right tools and statistical methods6,2,2,1,TRAIN
70,The data scientist first helps identify data analytics problems,1,2,1,TRAIN
71,Next he or she defines defines the right algorithm and tools,0,1,0,TRAIN
72,He or she cleans the data and collects the correct data for the problem,2,1,1,TRAIN
73,The next step is to define hyperparameters and engineer the features in a way that it fits the model,4,2,1,TRAIN
74,After the model provides output the data scientist analyzes and identifies patterns and trends,3,1,1,TRAIN
75,Then the data scientist communicates the results to the stakeholders,1,0,0,TRAIN
76,Machine The machine learns to recognize patterns in the data that it is fed to it and then maps these patterns to future outcomes,2,3,1,TRAIN
77,The machine learns through adjusting the weights and biases in the network from feedback to get to the correct outcome,5,2,1,TRAIN
78,This feedback must come from a trainer—the data scientist,3,1,1,TRAIN
79,The data scientist tells the model what should happen and what shouldn’t happen,2,1,1,TRAIN
80,This correction is then sent back through the network and an error rate is computed,4,2,1,TRAIN
81,With each iteration the model works to decrease the error rate,4,1,1,TRAIN
82,In the appendix section of this paper we have a section that addresses the different types of algorithms’ learning,5,1,1,TRAIN
83,There are four main types of learning supervised unsupervised transferred and reinforcement learning,2,2,1,TRAIN
84,While unsupervised reinforcement and transfer learning show great potential supervised learning is currently the type that can provide the highest economic value,2,3,1,TRAIN
85,What has driven the development of AI,1,1,1,TRAIN
86,With increasing computing power and more data the potential value of algorithms became higher,3,2,1,TRAIN
87,People and companies saw possibilities to embed these smart systems into their companies to drive strategy and innovation,2,3,1,TRAIN
88,As the power of algorithms computing and amounts of data increased companies started to see an increasing amount of use cases,4,3,1,TRAIN
89,AI started to become an essential value,1,1,1,TRAIN
90,Companies saw that these systems could move them closer to their customers drive efficiency enhance employee experience and capability automatize tasks decrease costs and improve revenue,6,5,1,TRAIN
91,But AI went through some lulls and spikes before it became capable of enabling so many benefits,0,3,0,TRAIN
92,At a certain point the general public gave up on AI and machine learning as a whole which stalled developments and investments,2,2,1,TRAIN
93,For instance when Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA worked together with Carnegie Mellon to implement speech recognition for their pilots they cut the project in 1974 after having spent millions of dollars on it,6,2,1,TRAIN
94,From the 1960s to 1974 the main funding for AI came from governments,1,1,1,TRAIN
95,But after 1974 there was barely any government funding because 6 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business of multiple failed AI projects so the belief in the feasibility of AI declined,7,5,1,TRAIN
96,But after this period improvements in efficiency lead to successful business cases once again proving value,3,2,1,TRAIN
97,Today we now see AI as one of the big value drivers for companies and to compete most companies must adopt AI strategies,2,2,1,TRAIN
98,Three topics have made AI available for many companies right now — The evolution of data A factor contributing to the massive adoption of AI is the exponential growth of available data,4,2,1,TRAIN
99,With the introduction of the Internet social media proliferation of sensors and smart devices and the fact that data storage became cheaper it became more accessible than ever before,4,1,1,TRAIN
100,— The evolution of algorithms Algorithms have been around since we could write,2,1,1,TRAIN
101,Recently the development of more advanced algorithms has helped AI become more powerful and efficient,1,3,1,TRAIN
102,— The evolution of computing Another major factor in AI’s current success is its computing power,5,1,1,TRAIN
103,Back when AI was just beginning to be developed the computing power was minimal,3,2,1,TRAIN
104,Computers nowadays can take much more data and heavier algorithms than in the 1950s,0,1,0,TRAIN
105,These developments would not have taken place without significant investments and proven business value,3,1,1,TRAIN

112,We can split the term AI into three categories general broad and narrow,2,0,0,TRAIN
113,General AI encompasses all the human like capabilities whereas narrow AI can only do a certain task—and it can do it quite well—but narrow AI can’t transfer its knowledge to different sorts of problems,4,2,1,TRAIN
114,Narrow AI Narrow AI is focused on addressing very focused tasks such as buying a book with a voice based device based on “common knowledge ” That’s the reason narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world where there are a lot of common tasks and data to train these systems,5,3,1,TRAIN
115,Narrow or weak AI is contrary to the naming very powerful at routine jobs,1,0,0,TRAIN
116,Figure 4 The three categories of AI,1,0,0,TRAIN
117,Narrow 2010 2015 Broad AI for Enterprise We are here General AI 2050 and beyond Broad AI What we see today in self driving cars is still defined as narrow AI,1,3,1,TRAIN
118,You can see it as a collection of narrow AI systems that make decisions,1,2,1,TRAIN
119,This is what we call broad AI,1,0,0,TRAIN
120,Another example of broad AI includes a system within a bank that analyzes the balance sheet of corporate customers to recommend the best currency hedging strategy,7,3,1,TRAIN
121,Another example would be a system that supports engineers who work on complex maintenance tasks on a platform in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,3,3,1,TRAIN
122,Broad AI is about integrating AI within a specific business process of an enterprise where you need business and enterprise specific knowledge and data to train this type of system,5,3,1,TRAIN
123,These tasks are very different from the narrow AI used in the consumer world because the data and knowledge available in the enterprise are much more limited in terms of volumes very industry specific and in most of the cases private for example owned by an enterprise,4,1,1,TRAIN
124,This is what we believe is currently the most valuable type of AI currently for the enterprise,1,1,1,TRAIN
125,General AI General AI is far from reaching its potential,0,1,0,TRAIN
126,The expectations are that it will take at least another couple of decades,1,1,1,TRAIN
127,General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task a human can,2,1,1,TRAIN
128,Currently AI does not have the ability to think abstractly strategize and use previous experiences to come up with new creative ideas as humans do,1,3,1,TRAIN
129,Some people think we will have general AI in a couple of decades others like IBM’s Rob High and Google’s Peter Norvig believe we don’t need broad AI at all 8 8 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business What are the areas in which AI provides the most value today,8,6,1,TRAIN
130,While relevant AI use cases span various areas across virtually every industry there are three main macro domains that continue to drive the adoption as well as the most economies across businesses,4,3,1,TRAIN
131,They are — Cognitive engagement Involves how to deliver new ways for humans to engage with machines moving from pure digital experiences such as the ability to run transactions digitally into human like natural conversations,2,4,1,TRAIN
132,— Cognitive insights and knowledge Addresses how to augment humans who are overwhelmed with information and knowledge,2,1,1,TRAIN
133,— Cognitive automation Relates to how to move from process automation to mimicking human intelligence to facilitate complex and knowledge intense business decisions,7,2,1,TRAIN
134,What are some examples of successful implementations,0,0,0,TRAIN
135,There’s a vast amount of problems AI is already addressing to deliver business value across the three macro domains described in the previous section,6,2,1,TRAIN
136,We want to explain a couple of use cases our IBM team has successfully completed to demonstrate where AI can bring value,8,1,1,TRAIN
137,Manufacturer engine anomaly detection using a neural network Using the many different available sensor measurements from large truck engines a neural network was trained to recognize normal and abnormal engine behavior,9,4,1,TRAIN
138,In the huge high dimensional many variables dataset the neural network learned the natural correlations and relationships between all different readings,2,3,1,TRAIN
139,The resulting model was able to predict “normal” values given certain operating conditions and could thus also be used to detect when specific measurements were out of the ordinary,3,3,1,TRAIN
140,Anomalous sensor readings are highly predictive of pending engine failures,2,1,1,TRAIN
141,Car manufacturer predictive failure detection for welding robots and predictive maintenance assessment Through supervised learning techniques predictive models were developed that could provide an early warning of failure based on the different system messages and sensor readings that continuously stream from the production line,11,6,1,TRAIN
142,This early warning could be used to prioritize maintenance and reduce both downtime as well as false positives and needless efforts,3,3,1,TRAIN
143,Working through this first proof of value the data scientists uncovered many data quality challenges that could be worked around to realize more value,3,4,1,TRAIN

146,This required both the prediction of demand as well as prediction of available solar and wind energy capacity,5,1,1,TRAIN
147,Material producer insights dashboard IBM worked with the client’s sourcing experts to understand the business dynamics and create inventory of possibly relevant data sources,6,5,1,TRAIN
148,Several machine learning models were then trained to learn the price behavior and forecast future price development,6,2,1,TRAIN
149,The models also enabled buyers to evaluate their own “what if” scenarios,0,2,0,TRAIN
150,This was further supplemented with IBM® Watson Discovery News service which identified the most relevant news articles related to the material of interest,3,3,1,TRAIN
151,This all came together for the user in an interactive dashboard to consume the insights and interact with the data and models to make buying decisions,3,2,1,TRAIN
152,Best practices to successfully implement AI within an organization Let’s discuss what you need to do before implementing AI,1,2,1,TRAIN
153,Currently many companies are scrambling to implement AI within their environments because they believe it will keep them ahead of the game—which if thought through is the case,1,4,1,TRAIN
154,But here are a few steps you need to take,0,2,0,TRAIN
155,We’ve defined three main steps to implement AI in your company,2,1,1,TRAIN
156,These steps are — Develop an AI strategy and roadmap — Establish AI capabilities and skills — Start small and scale quickly Develop an AI strategy and roadmap First it’s important to understand AI and to research what it can and can’t do for your organization,7,1,1,TRAIN
157,You can get more familiar with AI by collaborating with a data scientist because it’s important that the C level has a good understanding of AI and its implementation difficulties before they define where and how to implement,5,2,1,TRAIN
158,What often happens if AI is not holistically understood the overall project won’t provide value,2,2,1,TRAIN
159,Once AI is understood the next question you should ask yourself is “What specific problem do I want to solve or what opportunity do I want to take ” Is your company looking to drive efficiency in the back office differentiate its digital proposition generate new revenue streams by leveraging customers’ insights or even reinvent its entire business,14,8,1,TRAIN
160,10 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business After having thought this through you’ll probably have many different use cases,6,2,1,TRAIN
161,At this point it’s critical to prioritize these cases into a transformation roadmap that covers both a long term vision as well as concrete feasible quick wins,5,1,1,TRAIN
162,Next you should think about what data you have available,0,1,0,TRAIN
163,To solve most of the problems with AI you need to have relevant data,0,2,0,TRAIN
164,Without data AI will not provide any value,1,0,0,TRAIN
165,For many companies it’s a task in and of itself to keep track of the type of data—as well as where it’s stored and in what way,4,2,1,TRAIN
166,Often the first step will be to understand the data you currently have and the type you need to implement your AI case,2,2,1,TRAIN
167,Establish AI capabilities and skills AI requires a completely new set of capabilities and skills which may be in short supply in your organization,2,4,1,TRAIN
168,To build the required in house AI skills it’s important to plan establish and grow a dedicated Center of Competence or leverage the IBM Garage concept to perform in partnership,8,3,1,TRAIN
169,Not only this dedicated team is important but you also need to assure the right mindset and way of working in the rest of the organization,5,3,1,TRAIN
170,It’s critical that these functions occur in conjunction with developing and integrating an AI platform within your current IT architecture to implement and scale AI,5,2,1,TRAIN
171,Start small and scale quickly — Start with minimal valuable products MVPs In this phase you want to bring in experts to help quickly develop solutions to your business problems,4,3,1,TRAIN
172,This can only be done once the before mentioned steps are completed and the business is ready organizationally and technologically,1,2,1,TRAIN
173,This also means that the experts you bring in should be both business and technologically savvy,1,2,1,TRAIN
174,A good duration for a MVP is normally between two and three months,1,0,0,TRAIN
175,Our experience shows that starting with large scale complex and very long AI implementation projects normally lead to failure,3,1,1,TRAIN
176,— Set understandable key performance indicators KPIs To make sure that a project will succeed you need to define KPIs that are understandable for your business— including employees and other stakeholders,4,4,1,TRAIN
177,These KPIs will help you evaluate whether a project is successful,2,1,1,TRAIN
178,In general we suggest taking a second look at these KPIs after an appropriate duration to decide whether the project is successful or if you should discontinue it,4,1,1,TRAIN
179,If your business can’t pinpoint the right KPIs to measure success the project is too complex,6,1,1,TRAIN
180,— Roll out through company culture Once agreement is reached about which projects would be worth working on it’s time to implement the MVP within your company,4,2,1,TRAIN
181,It’s important that the way you implement it is looked at from both the business and the technical side,4,1,1,TRAIN
182,IBM Services 11 Pitfalls of AI implementation With the experience of implementing many of these cases we normally see a couple of problems organizations have when implementing AI,2,3,1,TRAIN
183,We’ve listed them because we feel it’s important to know what you should consider when implementing AI,1,2,1,TRAIN
184,Culture Pitfalls Looking at the advances we’ve made over the last decade gathering data is easy,2,3,1,TRAIN
185,But it’s what’s done with the data that provides the most value,2,2,1,TRAIN
186,The biggest pitfall we often encounter is a culture that’s not committed to making data driven decisions,3,1,1,TRAIN
187,Examples are cultures that can’t innovate in an agile fashion or can’t leave room for trial and error as are cultures that have traditionally been unwilling to transform a process,6,3,1,TRAIN
188,This reluctance usually has to do with fear of job loss skepticism or a knowledge gap,6,0,0,TRAIN
189,It’s a challenge to get your organization ready to embrace a data driven culture and for many of your employees it can feel like a counter intuitive process,7,2,1,TRAIN
190,Recommendation Digital change management training and preparation for the shift in thinking is required,6,2,1,TRAIN
191,You should start with small wins that are visible for relevant departments,0,1,0,TRAIN
192,The business users should be your starting point for agile development and in your design thinking process,6,2,1,TRAIN
193,All the results that come out of the project should be measurable this way you can easily show your wins,2,2,1,TRAIN
194,Then for a data driven culture to take hold the whole organization must embrace it,4,1,1,TRAIN
195,The message must be clear for all employees “Decision are made based on data ” Building trust within the company Pitfalls This step is often overlooked but when you want to implement AI you need get project stakeholders involved and on board,10,5,1,TRAIN
196,In Design Thinking IBM starts with the business and its users,1,1,1,TRAIN
197,A data scientist will require domain knowledge and access to data and the stakeholders should accommodate this need to help to speed up the process,6,4,1,TRAIN
198,Also consider the need for AI education and devote time to considering the right user interface,6,1,1,TRAIN
199,Recommendation Use a form of change management to establish user adoption,5,1,1,TRAIN
200,IBM’s best practice is to leverage its digital change approach to involve the users in the development of the project through studio’s in which we envision and co create together,10,0,0,TRAIN
201,AI is not something everyone will be able to grasp immediately,3,0,0,TRAIN
202,Working with AI should therefore be carefully implemented in the business environment,2,2,1,TRAIN
203,Expectation management Pitfalls In many cases we work on we see that employees or other stakeholders don’t believe in AI or think it’s a magical box we take from our office that will quickly solve all the problems a company,3,7,1,TRAIN
204,This leads to disappointment when an AI project is not delivered in a short timeframe or if it doesn’t deliver the expected results,3,2,1,TRAIN
205,And this disappointment can lead to a lack of belief that will eventually diminish the will to implement AI and experience the benefits of its long term possibilities,5,0,0,TRAIN
206,Recommendation Start with developing a solid strategy and roadmap,3,1,1,TRAIN
207,Define where you need to go and what you need to add to the organization to get there,2,2,1,TRAIN
208,First steps often include mundane items such as data governance and warehousing but you need to take these steps to properly implement AI,2,3,1,TRAIN
209,It’s therefore important to implement proper change management to guide the company,6,0,0,TRAIN
210,12 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business Bad data Pitfalls One problem we often come across is bad quality data,7,3,1,TRAIN
211,This problem derails limits and complicates many machine learning and AI projects,2,1,1,TRAIN
212,Bad or “dirty”data can mean fields are missing that there are duplicates in the data or that it’s outdated data contains spelling or punctuation errors and is generally incorrect,3,5,1,TRAIN
213,As we are moving toward more data driven decision making in enterprises it’s absolutely essential to have clean data,2,1,1,TRAIN
214,Outcomes derived from bad data will lead to incorrect decision making,3,1,1,TRAIN
215,Recommendation To overcome incorrect decision making based on bad data we suggest the enterprise incorporate standardization of data monitoring of data cleaning of incoming data and a centralized control of data,8,4,1,TRAIN
216,Sponsorship Pitfalls When implementing an AI strategy it’s important that the right people such as department heads CxOs or managers support the project,7,0,0,TRAIN
217,Implementing AI through the organization can be a long process and without support of the right people there’s a higher probability that the project will fail,7,2,1,TRAIN
218,What you might see when this problem occurs is that your employees might not put enough time into problem definition and subject knowledge sharing,6,3,1,TRAIN
219,Recommendation Align the right people before you start in a “garage” concept,4,1,1,TRAIN
220,The key stakeholders should be identified and should bring input and willingness to the table,3,1,1,TRAIN
221,Create buy in and support with employees other stakeholders management and C suite,2,0,0,TRAIN
222,Lack of capabilities Pitfalls Many companies want to implement machine learning right off the bat,2,2,1,TRAIN
223,But to implement AI you need to look at two things the first is acquiring or outsourcing your own data science talent and the second is looking at your current IT infrastructure,4,4,1,TRAIN
224,If you choose the in house route you’re taking a more challenging route,2,1,1,TRAIN
225,This option can be very rewarding but it’s important to take in account that it will require more time to set up infrastructures pipelines and research,5,2,1,TRAIN
226,If you decide to take this route you’ll need to acquire the following skills in house — Researchers to create new solutions to your products — Project managers to keep the team on track — Domain experts who have knowledge about your products customers and the business environment surrounding the product — Data engineers and machine learning engineers who can scale the algorithms — Data analysts who can process the outcome — Statisticians to help ensure quality results — Software engineers to turn all you’ve created into something that can be used by the masses—be it your customers or your employees While these roles don’t all need to be filled by individual employees it’s essential to have all these skills in house,17,15,1,TRAIN
227,The second option is easier and quicker to implement,3,0,0,TRAIN
228,In this case you’d make use of the capabilities of an external party such as through the IBM Garage offering which can give you the ability to use these capabilities without having to set up a complete internal department,6,3,1,TRAIN
229,IBM Services 13 Recommendation Before starting an AI project you should evaluate the capabilities you currently have inhouse and then define the cost you’ll occur acquiring the capabilities needed to close any gaps,4,5,1,TRAIN
230,Then you can define whether you want to hire these capabilities internally or use an external experienced resource to access the required capabilities,4,2,1,TRAIN
231,Scalability Pitfalls To properly scale the correct architecture integration and employees that know how to use them need be in place,4,2,1,TRAIN
232,Many data scientists believe that the research and development R D of a data science project is similar to a scaled IT implementation yet the two are very different,6,2,1,TRAIN
233,Also because there is increasing enterprise demand for AI organizations want to analyze large amounts of data,1,2,1,TRAIN
234,This can require quite a bit of time to train an algorithm—days or even weeks depending on the amount of data involved,4,2,1,TRAIN
235,We still encounter data scientists trying to perform this function on their laptops 9 Recommendation Develop a plan to set up the correct AI architecture a platform to deploy to a data integration strategy and properly trained data scientists,10,3,1,TRAIN
236,Not enough available data Pitfalls Data availability depends on the company and on how it stores data,2,1,1,TRAIN
237,Some organizations have the data but don’t have it readily available,0,0,0,TRAIN
238,Large corporations are challenged to locate and keep track of the right data,2,2,1,TRAIN
239,Smaller companies may be challenged by the amount of data they produce,2,2,1,TRAIN
240,Recommendation Not all problems need machine learning and AI,3,1,1,TRAIN
241,If you find yourself in a situation where you don’t have enough data you should carefully consider if you should launch your product using machine learning,5,3,1,TRAIN
242,If you choose that option but don’t have enough data you can overcome the problem by acquiring external data or by using simpler models,4,2,1,TRAIN
243,Unlabeled data Pitfalls A common problem when implementing AI is data that’s not classified by humans or machines which leaves you unable to train the system in the case of a supervised algorithm,3,4,1,TRAIN
244,For instance if you wanted to predict fraud but the historical fraudulent cases weren’t labelled it would be impossible for the algorithm to map input to outputs,6,3,1,TRAIN
245,Recommendation In this case define what data you’ll need to run a sound model,3,2,1,TRAIN
246,This data will then need to be labeled—which can be expensive—or you can use algorithms to accomplish this task,3,1,1,TRAIN
247,It’s a more advanced technique but you can use reinforcement learning or semi supervised models,2,3,1,TRAIN
248,Your data scientist might know which approach is best,2,1,1,TRAIN
249,Explainable results Pitfalls In many cases the business wants and needs to know why specific outcomes occur,1,3,1,TRAIN
250,This is in line with one of IBMs principles for ethical use of AI is AI systems must be transparent and explainable,2,2,1,TRAIN
251,Depending on what kind of algorithm is used an AI can’t show exactly which variables brought it to a given conclusion,3,4,1,TRAIN
252,We call these black box algorithms,1,1,1,TRAIN
253,While they sometimes may perform better they don’t give a lot of explanation,2,2,1,TRAIN
254,For example you might have an algorithm that defines whether an applicant gets a loan,2,2,1,TRAIN
255,According to European law in some countries if you deny the applicant you need to explain why you did so,4,2,1,TRAIN
256,Recommendation There are several new algorithms that help explain what happens in the black box models such as Local Interpretable Model Agnostic LIME 10 But this doesn’t solve the problem in all cases,5,2,1,TRAIN
257,You should therefore define what you’re going to use the model for,2,1,1,TRAIN
258,If the model needs to explain precisely why it came to a certain conclusion your data scientists should consider other models that provide the specific information required,4,5,1,TRAIN
259,Ethics and AI should go hand in hand,1,1,1,TRAIN
260,14 Beyond the hype A guide to understanding and successfully implementing artificial intelligence within your business Summary AI has the potential to bring a lot of value to your company if thought through and implemented properly,8,3,1,TRAIN
261,The authors of this paper hope we’ve made it clear how you can achieve this goal,3,1,1,TRAIN
262,We’ve discussed what AI is what it can do for your organization how it should be implemented and what pitfalls you should avoid once you’ve decided to implement AI,2,4,1,TRAIN
263,To sum up this paper’s key points AI not something of the future it is real today and it fuels the fourth Industrial Revolution As you will see later in this paper there are many cases where AI is being successfully implemented and driving competitive advantage,7,1,1,TRAIN
264,Companies such as IBM Nvidia Twitter Delta Airlines Walmart Netflix Spotify and Kreditech show that their data driven approach produces extremely valuable business models,2,2,1,TRAIN
265,But for many companies failing to implement a data driven strategy can lead to lost market share,4,2,1,TRAIN
266,Properly implementing AI requires careful evaluation and planning You need to evaluate how AI can help solve your problems where your company is right now in terms of capabilities and what needs to be done before you can properly implement AI to address the problems you want to solve or the opportunities you want to take,7,6,1,TRAIN
267,There is no one magic algorithm that can solve all your problems Before implementing AI you should focus on the problems you have and how AI can help you solve them,5,0,0,TRAIN
268,Next you need to check whether the data you need to solve your problems is available,0,3,0,TRAIN
269,Often a hybrid between algorithms can be the right fit depending on the problems you want to solve,2,2,1,TRAIN
270,Supervised learning provides the most economic value Supervised learning is currently the most applied form of learning and provides the most value for a wide variety of applications,4,3,1,TRAIN
271,When beginning to implement AI in your enterprise you’ll likely be working with supervised learning,2,2,1,TRAIN
272,In the next section of this paper we’ll talk about how IBM can play a role in implementing AI within your organization,6,1,1,TRAIN
273,IBM not only has many years of experience with these types of projects but has also been a pioneer in the AI arena,1,2,1,TRAIN
274,Based on its experience and knowledge IBM can help companies of all sizes implement AI solutions,3,2,1,TRAIN
275,IBM Services 15 IBM Services IBM has the experience and knowledge to help guide your company through a business and technology transformation,7,2,1,TRAIN
276,IBM puts this into practice through the “garage” concept,4,1,1,TRAIN

288,We start with ideas and get to working concepts fast incorporating feedback in real time,3,2,1,TRAIN
289,IBM helps you get prepared first in a fast pressure cooker environment,2,2,1,TRAIN
290,This helps you to kickstart your AI journey,1,2,1,TRAIN
291,IBM works with you to deliver an assessment of your current AI capabilities,0,2,0,TRAIN
292,In assessing your current AI capabilities IBM looks at many different aspects some of which are — Systems What does your innovation system look like,2,3,1,TRAIN
293,— People How skilled is your staff in AI,1,0,0,TRAIN
294,— Organization How do you position AI expertise in your organization,4,0,0,TRAIN
295,— Culture Do you operate in an agile fashion,3,0,0,TRAIN
296,— Data How readily available is your data,0,0,0,TRAIN
297,— Technology Does your current architecture enable AI,3,0,0,TRAIN
298,IBM works with you to define your AI Ambition as a high level AI strategic direction by looking at “big ideas” and by reflecting on persona’s and their user stories,5,3,1,TRAIN
299,A persona can be a marketing manager or a product developer,5,0,0,TRAIN
300,This ambition is translated into a roadmap and a high level business case,4,1,1,TRAIN
301,IBM also supports you to select the most favorable operating model to move forward,3,2,1,TRAIN
302,Once you are prepared for your garage IBM uses design thinking to identify and define use cases,4,2,1,TRAIN
303,All use cases are conceived based on the notion of creating business value,4,2,1,TRAIN
304,In IBM’s experience design thinking is the most effective way,3,1,1,TRAIN
305,This so called “demand generation” for the garage should be on going creating the backlog and setting the capacity planning for the garage,7,2,1,TRAIN
306,IBM Services 17 Once the first use cases have been agreed the garage provides the playground for deep technology accommodating enterprise scale ways of working—such as design thinking agile DevOps and lean IT,7,4,1,TRAIN
307,Innovation starts with a Proof of Value POV evaluating the business and technical feasibility of the use case in a time boxed agile manner,7,2,1,TRAIN
308,Agile development is at the core of what IBM does in the garage,3,0,0,TRAIN
309,The goal is to succeed or fail quickly with speed to scale,2,2,1,TRAIN
310,Flexibility and speed are key,2,0,0,TRAIN
311,A successful POV will move into a pilot implementation,3,0,0,TRAIN
312,The IBM Garage leverages IBM’s extensive asset library to more efficiently validate use cases and accelerate transformative change,4,2,1,TRAIN
313,Organizations should be prepared to step out of their comfort zones and think differently,2,1,1,TRAIN
314,Thinking in a data driven and AI approach requires a shift in the way we see,3,2,1,TRAIN
315,It takes some effort to change our ways of thinking,3,1,1,TRAIN
316,This is where digital change management plays a role,3,1,1,TRAIN
317,You also need to consider the buildup of AI capabilities in your organization,1,2,1,TRAIN
318,IBM offers various forms of training and enablement ranging from Hackathons planned learning universities for upskilling and an AI learning academy,1,6,1,TRAIN
319,In the “Transform” phase IBM collaborates with experts data and emerging technologies using accelerators to build minimum viable products into production and realize business outcomes and customer adoption within weeks,6,4,1,TRAIN
320,The third and last phase is the factory “Thrive” phase which is designed to rapidly scale solutions while establishing methods and new ways of working across your enterprise that can last a lifetime,5,3,1,TRAIN
321,The thrive phase works as a managed service to embed and maintain data and AI solutions at scale,3,2,1,TRAIN
322,Using a factory like approach you put into production something you want to be consistent in design and quality and that doesn’t require innovation in execution,7,4,1,TRAIN
323,IBM focuses on successful delivery of projects aligned to the roadmap and AI platform technology and helps ensure a clearly defined governance,4,5,1,TRAIN
324,Using this method IBM has been successful many times and wants to keep improving the method with each project delivered,2,4,1,TRAIN
325,IBM is one of the frontrunners of AI and AI implementation and thrives on applying its knowledge and experience to help improve the world,4,3,1,TRAIN

341,Appendix Different types of learning Learning,0,1,0,TRAIN
342,which is one of the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning is when the algorithm improves itself by looking at the data provided,3,3,1,TRAIN
343,There are two elements involved knowledge and feedback,2,1,1,TRAIN
344,Knowledge provides information that’s already in the data and the algorithm can learn from feedback through interactions with the user,3,4,1,TRAIN
345,This happens when a user gives the model feedback about correct or falsely predicted outcomes,1,3,1,TRAIN
346,There are four types of machine learning supervised unsupervised reinforcement and transfer,3,1,1,TRAIN
347,Currently the most often used type is supervised learning and thus we can say that the most economical value is created within this category,4,4,1,TRAIN
348,mailto Jorn Jansen Schoonhoven 40ibm com subject Beyond 20the 20hype mailto marloes roelands 40nl ibm com subject Beyond 20the 20hype mailto francesco brenna 40ch ibm com subject Beyond 20the 20hype IBM Services 19 Supervised learning is a learning method that maps an input to an output using human data and feedback to improve,8,3,1,TRAIN
349,A data set is provided with associated correct labels to the data,1,1,1,TRAIN
350,An example would be pictures of animals in which all pictures were correctly labelled as the animal in the pictures,1,2,1,TRAIN
351,Supervised learning trains based on historical data and builds rules that can be applied to predict future problems,1,3,1,TRAIN
352,The better the data set the better the output,3,0,0,TRAIN
353,You may use this type of learning when you want to classify or predict outcomes,2,2,1,TRAIN
354,With regression you are predicting a continuous value “How much will the stock price be ”,2,1,1,TRAIN
355,With classifying you are assigning a label to an input “Is this picture a man or a woman ”,3,1,1,TRAIN
356,Other examples would be using speech recognition to examine the sentiments of people calling your customer service center or image recognition to define products in a warehouse so they could be properly sorted,9,3,1,TRAIN
357,Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific “wrong” or “right” outcome,2,3,1,TRAIN
358,Instead the algorithm is given unlabeled data,0,1,0,TRAIN
359,Unsupervised learning is often used when you want to classify data but don’t know how to do so,3,3,1,TRAIN
360,For example you’d likely use unsupervised learning if you had a set of customer data and you didn’t know what kind of classes they would fit in,4,4,1,TRAIN
361,An unsupervised learning algorithm can find natural groupings of similar customers in a database and the user can then describe and label them,2,2,1,TRAIN
362,Reinforcement learning is a class in and of itself it is not given a specific goal but rather learns from trial and error,4,3,1,TRAIN
363,The main concept is that instead of a specific action being labelled there is a sequence of actions that is associated with a reward,4,2,1,TRAIN
364,If we take a maze as an example the algorithm will be rewarded when it comes closer to its goal and be penalized every time it gets stuck or moves away from the completion,6,4,1,TRAIN
365,A recent example of reinforcement learning is AlphaGo where Google trained a deep reinforcement learning network with many examples of the game Go eventually making its performance superior to that of even the best human,7,3,1,TRAIN
366,This trick is not new since it was used in TD Gammon in 1992 created by Gerald Tesauro at IBM,1,2,1,TRAIN
367,TD Gammon was a backgammon playing program that reached the performance of the best human players at the time,3,1,1,TRAIN
368,Reinforcement learning is not currently widely used but it does have high potential when developed more extensively,1,3,1,TRAIN
369,You would need a lot of data which is not always the case and takes time to process to be able to make reinforcement learning work,3,2,1,TRAIN
370,Transfer learning is when your algorithm learns to solve one problem takes information from this problem and then solves a new problem with that information,4,4,1,TRAIN
371,This currently happens a lot with image recognition,3,1,1,TRAIN
372,Pre trained neural networks are used to solve new problems,0,2,0,TRAIN

645,6 1 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER THE RISE OF AI Artificial intelligence AI deep learning machine learning — you hear these terms all the time but what do they really mean for businesses and more specifically for IT,6,0,0,TRAIN
646,AI technologies have come into the mainstream allowing businesses with foresight to deploy them to gain valuable real world benefits right now,2,2,1,TRAIN
647,Benefits that are driving business growth and advantages such as • Experiencing greater value from IT investments • Enhancing relationships with customers • Eliminating countless hours of repetitive and mundane management tasks • Helping to ensure that millions of everyday transactions are completed with both speed and accuracy The truth is the many of the world’s most innovative companies from small start ups to large established enterprises are well on their way with AI and its related technologies gaining immediate and long term benefits from infrastructure management to product innovation,15,9,1,TRAIN
648,Are you one of them and if not how do you get started,0,1,0,TRAIN
649,THE MAKING OF AN AI STRATEGY LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN Analysts agree Organizations with an AI strategy in place realize benefits others can’t,3,4,1,TRAIN
650,The gap between ambition and execution is large at most companies,3,0,0,TRAIN
651,Three quarters of executives believe AI will enable their companies to move into new revenue generating areas,0,2,0,TRAIN
652,Almost 85 percent believe AI will allow their companies to achieve or sustain a competitive advantage yet only about one in five companies has incorporated AI capabilities in offerings or processes,2,5,1,TRAIN
653,According to an MIT Sloan Management Review report the most advanced group of AI adopters comprises 19 percent of respondents whom the report refers as “AI Pioneers ” These Pioneers overwhelmingly see the need for an AI strategy with 85 percent agreeing they have an urgent need for an AI strategy and 90 percent saying they have a strategy in place already,6,7,1,TRAIN
654,Early AI adopters in business have seen their pioneering efforts rewarded,1,2,1,TRAIN
655,Responses show 81 percent have seen revenues rise in three years based on AI and are intending to forge further forward having gained both competence and a greater perspective on the possibilities,3,6,1,TRAIN
656,Based on the benefits of early applications we see great enthusiasm — but also a clear eyed understanding of the challenges of increasing AI investments and how to realize value at scale,3,5,1,TRAIN
657,The key differences lie in recognizing the transformative value of data defining a relevant AI use case putting in place AI enabled and AI enabling infrastructure and approaching the relationship to AI as an incremental journey not a destination,9,4,1,TRAIN
658,To learn more read the MIT Sloan Management Review’s report “Artificial Intelligence in Business Gets Real ” https sloanreview mit edu projects artificial intelligence in business gets real https sloanreview mit edu projects artificial intelligence in business gets real https sloanreview mit edu projects artificial intelligence in business gets real 2 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER Clearly the time to make AI part of your business strategy is now but determining a path for getting started is not always as clear,8,4,1,TRAIN
659,To help your organization see the way forward this paper offers a vision of the AI imperative as well as a view of what the journey — first steps and long term pace — looks like,9,2,1,TRAIN
660,WHY AI,0,0,0,TRAIN
661,WHY NOW,0,0,0,TRAIN
662,A first step in the AI journey begins with understanding where we are now why the age of AI has begun and why this is the perfect time for organizations large and small to take steps toward becoming an AI powered operation,5,4,1,TRAIN
663,Generally speaking three main technology advances are converging to make AI at scale more viable accessible and imperative today,4,2,1,TRAIN
664,These advances are • The never ending march of Moore’s Law delivering compute at scale distributed across data centers clouds connected devices and embedded intelligence • The emergence of the Internet of Things IoT cloud native applications and new data storage methods that when combined generate store and protect massive amounts of data at scale with more and more new data from all that compute rapidly adding to historical data • The maturation of more precise algorithms that can make sense of data and reveal powerful actionable insights that enable next generation customer experiences enhanced business processes across all industries and continuously optimized infrastructure,19,9,1,TRAIN
665,Most of all there can be no AI without data,0,0,0,TRAIN
666,Data is the fuel for the modern era,3,0,0,TRAIN
667,The deeper larger and more complex our data stores and streams become the more critical the role of AI becomes,3,2,1,TRAIN
668,Using data AI is helping organizations accelerate outcomes drive business growth and make smarter more accurate decisions across an endless number of industries and use cases,5,5,1,TRAIN
669,USEFUL DEFINITIONS BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE BI involves the process of collecting data from many sources and preparing it for Business Analytics,0,3,0,TRAIN
670,BUSINESS ANALYTICS BA is the process of describing past performance to gain insights of the data through analysis reporting queries or visualizations,6,1,1,TRAIN
671,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI is the development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition and translation between languages etc,3,1,1,TRAIN
672,MACHINE LEARNING ML is a sub field of AI that provides systems the ability to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed,4,4,1,TRAIN
673,DEEP LEARNING DL is a type of ML built on a deep hierarchy of interconnected “neural network” layers with ability to learn key “features” from data provided,5,4,1,TRAIN
674,3 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER IMPORTANCE OF AI TO LIFE — AND BUSINESS — AND PROCESSES Let’s get aspirational for a moment How might AI transform the way people live and work,3,4,1,TRAIN
675,The possibilities are as endless as the infinite volumes and varieties of data being created all around us at every moment,1,2,1,TRAIN
676,Much like the printing press which unlocked the vaults of human knowledge freeing it from the libraries of monasteries and placing it in the hands of the masses igniting an era of unprecedented creativity and innovation that laid the foundation for the modern age AI too will usher in an era of explosive innovation igniting the next major epoch of human experience,9,6,1,TRAIN
677,This new epoch will be driven by the realization that the value of AI is less about artificial intelligence that replaces human experience and more about augmenting human intelligence freeing humans to focus on higher order challenges and helping us make better decisions faster,7,6,1,TRAIN
678,This human AI partnership will unleash creativity and innovation not possible by humans or machines alone,3,0,0,TRAIN
679,This is why studies suggest that AI will create more jobs than it eliminates and organizations of all kinds will benefit from these new human machine partnerships,1,3,1,TRAIN
680,AI BENEFITS The driving force behind AI is its power to accelerate human progress from the everyday to the life altering,5,1,1,TRAIN
681,AI has broad applicability spanning both public and private sectors and markets of all kinds from industrial to medical from education to finance,3,1,1,TRAIN
682,Here is a sampling of the impacts AI is already having • Bionic vision The Computer Vision Group at CSIRO Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has developed software for a bionic vision solution designed to restore sight for people with profound vision loss,7,3,1,TRAIN
683,This life changing advance uses large scale image datasets to learn to recognize more types of images,2,3,1,TRAIN
684,• Safer surgeries A study that involved 379 orthopedic patients found that AI assisted robotic procedures resulted in five times fewer complications compared to surgeons operating alone,2,5,1,TRAIN
685,• Better dressed less stressed human beings Stitch Fix uses AI to enhance the company’s personal styling services,3,1,1,TRAIN
686,• Enhanced credit card fraud protection Mastercard uses machine learning algorithms to examine 160 million transactions per hour by applying 1 9 million rules each transaction — all in a matter of milliseconds,9,4,1,TRAIN
687,• Better identity verification Mastercard goes beyond facial recognition to learn motions unique to each user and determine if “you’re really you” by for example how you hold your phone while using it,7,4,1,TRAIN
688,AI CHALLENGES As with every new technology AI comes with unique challenges especially in the realm of data and compute,2,1,1,TRAIN
689,Data is the raw material of AI it feeds the systems that glean the insights and make the predictions and the more data the more accurate AI can become,2,2,1,TRAIN
690,But all data is not good data,0,0,0,TRAIN
691,Data is often messy — it’s duplicated incomplete geo biased and requires data engineering — so simplifying data acquisition management access and protection are all critical,6,4,1,TRAIN
692,It’s all about separating the signal from the noise and ensuring you have the right skills tools and use cases in place to do so,3,3,1,TRAIN
693,According to IDC’s findings the amount of data created and replicated experienced unusually high growth in 2020 due to the dramatic increase in the number of people working learning and entertaining themselves from home,5,5,1,TRAIN
694,However less than 2 percent of this new data was saved and retained into 2021,1,1,1,TRAIN
695,"Source IDC ""Data Creation and Replication Will Grow at a Faster Rate than Installed Storage Capacity According to the IDC Global DataSphere and StorageSphere Forecasts ” March 24 2021 https www csiro au en News News releases 2017 CSIRO powers bionic vision research with new Dell EMC https www forbes com sites bernardmarr 2018 07 27 how is ai used in healthcare 5 powerful real world examples that show the latest advances 6870bfa05dfb https www forbes com sites bernardmarr 2018 05 25 stitch fix the amazing use case of using artificial intelligence in fashion retail 352fd1743292 https www dellemc com en us solutions artificial intelligence index htm overlay https www emc com collateral whitepaper mastercard fighting fraud the smart way pdf https www dellemc com en us solutions artificial intelligence index htm overlay https www emc com collateral whitepaper mastercard fighting fraud the smart way pdf https www idc com getdoc jsp containerId prUS47560321 https www idc com getdoc jsp containerId prUS47560321 https www idc com getdoc jsp containerId prUS47560321 https www idc com getdoc jsp containerId prUS47560321 https www idc com getdoc jsp containerId prUS47560321 4 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER In addressing your data challenges keep these points in mind • Data is everywhere but not always where you need it so it’s becoming more and more essential in the age of IoT for example to move compute capabilities to where the data resides",11,8,1,TRAIN
696,• Data is overwhelming in that it touches every part of modern business and is endlessly and exponentially growing,4,1,1,TRAIN
697,This makes it all the more important to identify specific areas in which to begin AI implementations and ensure those implementations allow you the ability to seamlessly scale as your AI focus grows,2,4,1,TRAIN
698,Further massive data sets and modern algorithms require powerful compute and cost efficient and performance optimized storage,3,0,0,TRAIN
699,These solutions are often accelerated with graphics processing units GPUs which are efficient at processing large blocks of data in parallel and field programmable gate arrays FPGAs a type of semiconductor that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing,4,3,1,TRAIN
700,However where analytics operations are executed varies based on workload,1,2,1,TRAIN
701,• For real time decisions the high cost of transport and the need to minimize latency means that being able to move the algorithms and the compute to the data is essential for success,6,3,1,TRAIN
702,• For workloads that require direct access to massive amounts of data across a variety of data sources moving data to compute makes sense,4,3,1,TRAIN
703,• Sometimes it’s a combination of the two where data can be analyzed and acted on against locally but still benefit from federated insights across multiple similar locations,2,2,1,TRAIN
704,In short all three of the core elements algorithms data compute need to be fluid and movable,1,1,1,TRAIN
705,We must be able to take any two of these key elements to the other depending on the use case where it matters and when it matters to the business,3,2,1,TRAIN
706,OPPORTUNITIES AND USE CASES So how do you in your current situation start doing more with AI and ML technologies to influence the future arc of your organization,5,1,1,TRAIN
707,The first step is identifying a use case or a series of use cases that will help deliver the outcomes you have in mind,5,3,1,TRAIN
708,Are there “adjacent spaces” you might do well to explore,1,1,1,TRAIN
709,That is concurrent business models somewhat removed from your own but with service synergies and demographic or logistical overlaps that might lead you to tap into vast new revenue streams,4,3,1,TRAIN
710,What new product and service innovation secrets are buried inside customer feedback data,5,1,1,TRAIN
711,AI and ML may help you answer those questions,0,2,0,TRAIN
712,RECOGNIZE THAT IT’S A JOURNEY Data is at the heart of the AI journey,2,0,0,TRAIN
713,Data is fundamental for AI and its subfields including machine learning and deep learning,3,2,1,TRAIN
714,Given this reality the AI journey begins with the consolidation of data for analytics and then builds from there creating analytics based applications to drive the intelligence modeling and inferencing that is driven by data,4,4,1,TRAIN
715,While the path to AI is different for all organizations here are some common steps in the AI journey • Outline the business goals and align the company’s AI strategy to define the use case s • Determine data availability and prepare the data for AI analysis and action • Understand and integrate infrastructure requirements • Determine steps to build models with validation methodologies • Establish tracking tools and systems • Adapt and scale the strategy over time 5 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER TIPS FROM IDC Based on a study of the characteristics of leading IT organizations IDC offers these recommendations for organizations that want to create a stable foundation for unlocking data capital • Embrace autonomous infrastructure that will eliminate tedious maintenance and management tasks and allow IT staff to focus on more strategic initiatives,28,10,1,TRAIN

757,Our oncology focused NLP system is designed to identify the positive occurrences of desired oncology concepts such as cancer type TNM stage and biomarkers as well as enable the exclusion of semantic contexts that are not desired oncology contexts,8,2,1,TRAIN
758,For example if the goal is to identify patients with prostate cancer the Optum NLP system identifies different semantic contexts and appropriately extracts the desired contexts into a structured format,7,2,1,TRAIN
759,The concepts are then able to be easily searched by our clients,0,1,0,TRAIN

776,Our sophisticated system goes beyond term matching and rules based approaches by incorporating machine learning and deep learning in order to ensure the correct identification of the desired oncology context,6,5,1,TRAIN
777,The advantage of leveraging supervised machine learning models is the ability to accurately identify the appropriate contexts in an automated fashion over highly variable text,5,4,1,TRAIN
778,Our supervised machine learning models are trained to identify broader patterns that are not explicitly and manually created by a human as a rule but instead the machine learns from a sample of labeled data that will then enable the system to generalize to relevant contexts,5,5,1,TRAIN
779,Our models are evaluated against a held out annotated test set which the models has not seen before,2,2,1,TRAIN
780,The results of this test help ensure we are not overfitting to the training data and that the model will remain reliably accurate with new data,2,3,1,TRAIN
781,Annotation design and gold standard data development The thoughtful crafting and designing of an annotation scheme and appropriate sampling of notes to annotate are critical to ensure high performing NLP models,7,3,1,TRAIN
782,The annotation design and sampling methodology is systematically developed with NLP data scientists specialized in the field of clinical NLP in close consultation with clinical experts oncologists oncology clinicians pharmacists molecular biologists medical informaticists and other physicians,6,3,1,TRAIN
783,During the annotation design stage the team carefully and thoughtfully outlines the entities and relations to annotate and extract,5,1,1,TRAIN

804,1 Think Local How to Migrate Intelligence from the Cloud to Embedded Devices at the Edge Chris Shore Director of Embedded Solutions White Paper For the rapidly expanding Internet of Things “Think Local Act Global” is a guiding principle,1,3,1,TRAIN
805,Traditionally decision making has been concentrated in the cloud at the centre moving all the data and intelligence inwards,5,1,1,TRAIN
806,This places huge strain on the technical and commercial model of the network,2,1,1,TRAIN
807,In the future we need to deliberately shift much of the “thinking” to the e g of the network leaving the central systems to make longer term strategic decisions based on aggregation of data trends and patterns,3,6,1,TRAIN
808,In this paper we discuss how Arm and its partners are enabling a step change increase in e g compute capability whether that’s tiny microcontrollers or multi core gateways,5,1,1,TRAIN
809,Rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach we provide a unique combination of compute scalability power efficiency determinism and interface options,9,2,1,TRAIN
810,This is making it possible to do the tactical action taking quickly and autonomously away from the centre relieving pressure on bandwidth increasing security reducing latency and improving reliability,6,5,1,TRAIN
811,2 Introduction We have seen huge growth in computing over the last 30 or so years moving through many stages in that time,2,3,1,TRAIN
812,30 years ago compute workstations were special,1,0,0,TRAIN
813,Your company might have had one your school might have had one if you were lucky you might have had one on your desk,3,0,0,TRAIN
814,If you were a really early adopter you might have had one at home,2,0,0,TRAIN
815,A small number of powerful computers were shared amongst many users,1,1,1,TRAIN
816,Next came the personal computing era in which all of us had a computer on our desks and many of us had one at home,4,1,1,TRAIN
817,After that it was the age of mobile computing in which each one of us carries in our pocket a compute device more powerful than anything of even ten years earlier,6,1,1,TRAIN
818,Finally we reach the era of connected computing in which all these devices e g nodes gateways and servers are connected and share information across the world,5,3,1,TRAIN
819,From only a relatively small number of computers 30 years ago we now live in a world in which computing devices are everywhere,2,1,1,TRAIN
820,And increasingly they derive their value from the fact that they are connected into a huge network of intelligence,4,1,1,TRAIN
821,The commercial possibilities are endless,0,1,0,TRAIN
822,However scaling is becoming a problem,1,1,1,TRAIN
823,A Gartner Special Report predicts that “a typical family home could contain more than 500 smart devices by 2022 ” That’s a lot of devices to connect secure and manage,5,3,1,TRAIN
824,Arm’s silicon partners have shipped over 100 billion chips since we started back in 1990,1,2,1,TRAIN
825,50 billion of those have been in the last four years,0,0,0,TRAIN
826,We expect another 100 billion in the next four years,0,1,0,TRAIN
827,Figure 1 Market trends and the acceleration of technology deployment Much of this staggering growth will be in IoT,6,1,1,TRAIN
828,These devices derive much of their value from being connected to something central through which they provide a service to users and suppliers,3,2,1,TRAIN
829,3 Where is the intelligence,1,0,0,TRAIN
830,A,0,0,0,TRAIN
831,The current assumptions Currently the assumption is that the intelligence lies in the cloud at the centre of the network,5,1,1,TRAIN
832,This has the advantage of concentrating all the data in one place but it also comes with some significant and growing problems,2,3,1,TRAIN
833,Fundamentally it means that we have to spend time energy and money transmitting data all the way from the e g to the centre for analysis,6,2,1,TRAIN
834,And then transmitting analysis and actions back out to the edge,2,1,1,TRAIN
835,So what we have now are systems in which all data is shipped to the cloud,1,1,1,TRAIN
836,Transmitting all this data to the cloud for processing and then returning the actions all the way to the e g takes too long costs too much compromises privacy uses power and doesn’t scale,6,4,1,TRAIN
837,The founder of an IoT start up recently said “We like to say that the cloud is a way to scale AI but to me it’s a roadblock to AI,6,2,1,TRAIN
838,There is no cloud that can digest this much data ” Much better would be to build the intelligence into the gateway or into the e g device itself,3,2,1,TRAIN
839,This reduces latency improves privacy and security and reduces bandwidth,3,2,1,TRAIN
840,Then the data sent to the server becomes even more valuable to the service provider as only high quality information derived from the data is sent to the centre where it can be aggregated and transformed into real business value,10,3,1,TRAIN
841,B,0,0,0,TRAIN
842,The benefits of e g compute Moving intelligence to the e g offers many benefits,2,1,1,TRAIN
843,It improves local autonomy increases security and privacy and enhances safety,4,2,1,TRAIN
844,It also allows us to reduce energy consumption a few millwatts per device across a trillion devices is a lot of energy reduce latency and reduce bandwidth requirements,4,2,1,TRAIN
845,There are significant benefits to be had,0,0,0,TRAIN
846,And as a solution it scales to large numbers and large networks much better,1,1,1,TRAIN
847,Figure 2 Requirements for intelligent e g computing 4 Think local So here is a new principle “Think Local”,2,1,1,TRAIN
848,Do the thinking at the edge rather than at the centre,2,1,1,TRAIN
849,However we still have to work within the usual constraints that apply at the e g of the system devices need to be energy efficient cost effective often battery powered and usually physically small,2,4,1,TRAIN
850,Arm has traditionally operated in this area and much of our technology directly addresses these constraints helping to build powerful efficient intelligent e g devices,2,4,1,TRAIN
851,Figure 3 Benefits of e g compute Figure 4 “Think local” concept that combines these key elements 5 Three key technologies that will impact moving intelligence to the e g are security digital signal processing DSP and Machine Learning,8,1,1,TRAIN
852,I will now go into detail about these technologies,1,1,1,TRAIN
853,A Anatomy of an embedded device A typical embedded device senses some inputs from its environment and actuates some control output,5,2,1,TRAIN
854,Within the system on chip SoC key IP blocks may include I O and analog interfaces specific to the application memory for code and data and of course a CPU to perform the necessary compute,7,2,1,TRAIN
855,Key design criteria are We have enough of the right kind of compute capability The device is power efficient The right support is available in terms of software IP RTOS middleware and development tools It implements an appropriate level of security Figure 5 How an embedded device senses inputs from its environment and actuates some control output Note that even without connectivity to an external system security is often still a critical component to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data and firmware and to control lifecycle management,23,3,1,TRAIN
856,Security may also offer protection to the manufacturer and supply chain to validate the authenticity of the device and ensure it’s not a counterfeit or cloned part,10,3,1,TRAIN
857,Connecting a device to external central systems adds a whole new level of complexity and affects the design criteria in many ways,4,3,1,TRAIN
858,6 B,0,0,0,TRAIN
859,Extending with connectivity When the device is connected securely to “the cloud” to enable an IoT “service” the cloud has to be able to “trust” the device and this makes the security requirements significantly more important,8,3,1,TRAIN
860,The service will be enabled by software running both on the device and in the cloud for example processing captured data locally on the device and sending information about “interesting” events or situations to the cloud where it can be turned into long term actionable insights,8,7,1,TRAIN
861,An IoT device also needs to be manageable this includes provisioning the device when if first connects to the cloud authenticating it when it communicates controlling updates and security patches and securely terminating its operation at the end of life,5,6,1,TRAIN
862,The physical connectivity needs suitable transport layer security to ensure that private data is kept private and to avoid all sorts of communication attacks such as man in the middle attacks,3,3,1,TRAIN
863,As you can see security requirements touch many parts of this design including identity connectivity and device lifecycle management,8,1,1,TRAIN
864,So we’ll look at security first,1,1,1,TRAIN
865,Increase security First let’s take a look at how Arm technology provides the foundation on which you can build a secure solution,6,3,1,TRAIN
866,A,0,0,0,TRAIN
867,Security architecture and IP Figure 6 Platform Security Architecture 7 The Platform Security Architecture or PSA was introduced by Arm in 2017 It is an open methodology for analyzing threats architecting secure designs and then implementing secure solutions,4,4,1,TRAIN
868,The analysis stage is very important,2,0,0,TRAIN
869,Not all security solutions are applicable to all situations,1,0,0,TRAIN
870,For instance a device which is not physically accessible may not require mitigation for physical security threats,4,1,1,TRAIN
871,In all cases the security solutions you adopt must be appropriate and proportionate to the threats that you identify,2,3,1,TRAIN
872,PSA talks about four main types of threat Physical Invasive and non invasive Software Buffer overflow interrupts and malware Communication Man in the middle weak RNG and code vulnerability Lifecycle Code downgrade ownership change over production and debug attack Figure 7 Four main types of threat Arm has hardware and software IP to address these four main threat types technologies like Arm TrustZone help to protect against software threats hardware IP like Arm CryptoCell helps protect against communication threats Arm Cortex M35P SecureCore processors and Arm CryptoIsland products help protect against physical attacks,17,5,1,TRAIN
873,Arm Kigen family of products helps protect against communication and mitigation attacks,3,1,1,TRAIN

876,Arm secure foundations help design secure devices faster Arm secure foundations and Corstone foundation IP offer SoC designers a great solution to build secure designs faster,4,4,1,TRAIN
877,A range of secure foundations allows for constrained mainstream and rich embedded designs,4,2,1,TRAIN
878,Constrained designs are based around Cortex M microcontrollers mainstream designs incorporate multiple processors and rich designs use Cortex A processors for increased performance,2,6,1,TRAIN
879,Figure 8 Arm Secure Foundation The accompanying software packages include security RTOS and firmware support,6,2,1,TRAIN
880,Using these designs as a starting point can significantly reduce your design time and get your product to market more quickly,5,4,1,TRAIN
881,Optimized DSP functions Much of the intelligent behavior that we need to implement relies on having access to optimized software libraries particularly for functions like DSP and Neural Network acceleration,4,3,1,TRAIN
882,The two are very closely related,0,0,0,TRAIN
883,A Scalable DSP performance for e g devices In one sense all Arm processors are perfectly capable of executing any DSP algorithms,4,1,1,TRAIN
884,However as you would expect some are better at it than others,0,1,0,TRAIN
885,https developer arm com products system design corstone foundation ip 9 You can see an indication of the range of performance points that are available in Figure 9 below,5,0,0,TRAIN
886,Figure 9 Relative performance points for Cortex M processors with DSP extensions The Cortex M4 processor for instance has many DSP instructions to improve performance,5,1,1,TRAIN
887,The Cortex M33 processor offers roughly a 10 improvement on that,3,1,1,TRAIN
888,The Arm Cortex M7 processor however currently the highest performance microcontroller core yields a 50 to 75 improvement for many algorithms,6,0,0,TRAIN
889,And if you need significantly higher performance it is worth considering using a Cortex A processor instead,3,1,1,TRAIN
890,The Cortex A32 one of the smallest Cortex A devices provides between 200 and 400 improvement over Cortex M4,2,1,1,TRAIN
891,However extracting maximum performance for complex algorithms like this is often very difficult relying on specialist knowledge and very careful optimization,5,2,1,TRAIN
892,The good news is that there is a huge and growing ecosystem of support for just this problem,3,1,1,TRAIN

916,Today over 95 of AI enabled devices are in mobile smart home and IoT market segments with the remaining 5 in infrastructure,5,1,1,TRAIN
917,From that data we can conclude that over 90 of the AI enabled devices being shipped today are based on Arm architecture,3,3,1,TRAIN
918,Only Arm through Project Trillium has the breadth of hardware and software IP offerings and the partner ecosystem to address all these market segments,7,0,0,TRAIN

927,https developer arm com technologies machine learning on arm https developer arm com ethos 12 All of these architectures can be combined in many different possible heterogeneous systems,2,1,1,TRAIN
928,For instance always on functionality might be provided by small and highly efficient processors coupled with much more powerful processors and accelerators in the same physical device,3,2,1,TRAIN
929,All of this benefits from extensive software support specialist Neural Network software packages such as the open source Arm CMSIS NN library as well as the more general purpose Compute Libraries,4,0,0,TRAIN
930,All of them seamlessly support the same machine learning API across a variety of underlying compute hardware,5,2,1,TRAIN

938,If space were available we could also have talked about Arm’s significant investment in Functional Safety increasingly important for a wide range of medical and automotive applications or the way in which Arm’s technology range scales easily from the smallest requirements to the most demanding systems or how Arm IP makes it easy to build heterogeneous systems that combine extreme efficiency cost effectiveness and almost unlimited processing power all in the same device,9,5,1,TRAIN

950,The term Natural Language NL —and its family of synonymous abbreviations Natural Language Understanding NLU Natural Language Processing NLP and Natural Language Technology NLT —have been held up as the panacea for improving the accuracy of a speech system,5,3,1,TRAIN
951,Natural language suggests that rather than constrain a caller to a list of choices the caller can say anything in any context and be understood by the system,5,3,1,TRAIN
952,Speech vendors trumpet their NL capabilities linguists at research labs talk about advancements in NLP technology contact centers evaluating vendor proposals ask for explanations of available NLU features and industry press proclaim NLT as the future of speech recognition,13,3,1,TRAIN
953,The problem is that the term “natural language” has become meaningless,4,1,1,TRAIN
954,This standard speech industry terminology is anything but standard,5,0,0,TRAIN
955,It implies that you could call up a travel service and say “I’d like a flight to London for the 25th for two adults no wait make that two adults and an infant on my lap and can I have two aisle seats next to each other ” The term natural language is vague and overused full of promise yet promising nothing,9,7,1,TRAIN
956,For it to mean something one needs specifics,1,1,1,TRAIN
957,In this paper the specific benefits of natural language in speech recognition are explained and the approaches examined in detail,5,2,1,TRAIN
958,By the time you’ve finished reading you’ll understand natural language and how it can be effective in improving the overall accuracy of your speech based IVR system while providing callers a more engaging experience,6,5,1,TRAIN
959,Speech enabled automation Interactive Voice Response IVR systems are at the heart of today’s contact center self service solutions,5,0,0,TRAIN
960,Without IVR systems to automate calls most contact centers would be overwhelmed by operating costs and by angry customers facing long queue times,2,3,1,TRAIN
961,But by automating common customer service requests customers can resolve many issues quickly and agents can focus on helping the customers who truly need them,2,4,1,TRAIN
962,Speech enabled IVRs improve the overall automation rate of self service systems,2,1,1,TRAIN
963,Unlike an IVR with only touchtone options a speech based self ser vice system can handle more complex tasks like updating an address and can simplifying existing tasks to further increase automation,5,2,1,TRAIN
964,The resulting increase in automation rates mean more satisfied customers and lower costs for the contact center,3,3,1,TRAIN
965,Nevertheless the automation rate can only be as good as the accuracy during the caller’s entire interaction with a speech recognition system,8,0,0,TRAIN
966,Several recognition factors can limit the automation rate of a speech system,5,1,1,TRAIN
967,White PaperCustomer Service Solutions Natural language understanding2 Automation Preferences “Which of the example systems do you find most appealing ” Consumers found the speech applications overwhelmingly more appealing,3,3,1,TRAIN
968,Source Harris Interactive 41 Natural Language 38 Directed dialog 20 Touch tone Noisy backgrounds confused callers very heavy accents and mumbled responses can make it hard for a system to complete a call,6,3,1,TRAIN
969,Of course those factors can affect the ability of a live agent to complete those calls as well,3,3,1,TRAIN
970,And despite much advancement in technology it is still possible for a speech recognition engine to simply make a mistake,6,1,1,TRAIN
971,Learning to speak customer ese As all contact center agents know callers truly believe they are speaking in a clear and obvious manner when they are explaining their concerns,3,4,1,TRAIN
972,In fact each caller is really speaking in ‘customer ese’ their own personal dialect that agents and IVR systems need to decode,5,2,1,TRAIN
973,This interpretation process is very similar to learning a new foreign language,3,1,1,TRAIN
974,To address the challenge many speech recognition systems have a list of acceptable phrases known as the grammar that the system is programmed to recognize at any given time,6,4,1,TRAIN
975,Grammars ensure that a speech recognition engine knows that the phrase “new to speech” is not a “nudist beach” and that “agent ” “operator ” and “I want to speak to someone” all direct the caller to a live person,11,4,1,TRAIN
976,If implementing a speech enabled self service system is like teaching a foreign language then a grammar is like a translation book mapping com mon phrases to their meaning,7,3,1,TRAIN
977,It works quite well… as long as people stick to those phrases,0,2,0,TRAIN
978,So what happens if a phrase is not in the book,1,1,1,TRAIN
979,When a caller believes that a speech system has misrecognized his or her response it is more likely that the caller spoke something which was out of grammar—the system simply wasn’t expecting the caller to respond quite like that,8,4,1,TRAIN
980,An analysis of a number of representative speech applications confirms that out of grammar errors outnumber misrecognition errors by a factor of as high as 5 to 1,4,3,1,TRAIN
981,Put simply the problem is not recognizing what the caller said… it’s knowing what the caller meant,4,3,1,TRAIN
982,Therefore to increase the accuracy of any system—improving its automation rate making customers happier with the use of the system and lowering overall costs for the contact center—a critical factor is to reduce these out of grammar errors,6,6,1,TRAIN
983,So how can we teach a speech recognition system to speak this language of the customer,6,0,0,TRAIN
984,Different natural language capabilities provide different approaches to tackling that problem,2,2,1,TRAIN
985,White PaperCustomer Service Solutions Natural language understanding3 The Need for Natural Language A Typical Example CALLER I guess I’d like billing,3,0,0,TRAIN
986,I said billing,1,1,1,TRAIN
987,Billing,1,0,0,TRAIN
988,BILLING,1,0,0,TRAIN
989,Would you like account information billing or technical support,4,1,1,TRAIN
990,SYSTEM I’m sorry I didn’t understand what you said I’m sorry I didn’t understand what you said please wait for the next available agent,6,2,1,TRAIN
991,Make the translation book bigger You can make the grammar contain a larger list of entries to appear like natural language is at work,7,2,1,TRAIN
992,This works best when trying to pick between a limited number of responses for instance a confirmation dialog may recognize yes yup you betcha sure heck yeah as well as many other variations of a positive response,9,3,1,TRAIN
993,This straightforward brute force technique can provide a semblance of natural language understanding,6,1,1,TRAIN
994,However the approach has significant drawbacks as the list of possible responses gets longer and longer,2,1,1,TRAIN
995,It becomes harder to tune and maintain a system while keeping track of all these options,4,2,1,TRAIN
996,Even worse it is possible for the overall performance of the system to decrease as the recognition engine struggles to compare the caller’s response to such a potentially confusing list of phrases,8,2,1,TRAIN
997,The reality is that it is impossible to foresee and capture every conceivable response variant even in a very large grammar,6,0,0,TRAIN
998,To learn to speak customer ese the self service system needs more natural language capabilities,2,1,1,TRAIN
999,Learn to recognize variations of phrases Since every caller expresses themselves in a unique manner often adding extraneous information to their response focusing on recognizing certain keywords is another approach for avoiding out of grammar errors and achieving higher automation rates,6,6,1,TRAIN
1000,Keyword spotting sometimes referred to as robust parsing is used when a caller says what the system is expecting but surrounds their response with filler phrases,6,4,1,TRAIN
1001,Instead of simply saying “Yes” they may actually say “Um I think so yes”,2,2,1,TRAIN
1002,The keyword spotting approach is most effective with short menus and yes no dialogs which typically account for more than 70 of speech enabled application interactions,5,3,1,TRAIN
1003,This statistical technique is based on comparing vocabularies of filler phrases created from transcriptions of previous calls or from classes of common phrases refined over time,3,2,1,TRAIN
1004,Applying these vocabularies can provide an impressive 30 or more increase in recognition accuracy,4,2,1,TRAIN
1005,As callers have more flexibility in how they can exactly respond the caller’s perceived accuracy is typically very high when using keyword spotting,4,3,1,TRAIN
1006,As with any increase in accuracy callers also appreciate interactions that avoid retry prompts and repeated confirmations,3,3,1,TRAIN
1007,Although the self service system has already taken a big step towards learning to speak customer ese the caller’s responses are still limited to words that have been chosen for them rather than allowing them to use their own words,5,4,1,TRAIN
1008,There are still more natural language capabilities to explore,1,0,0,TRAIN
1009,Become fluent Rather than focusing only on matches within and around a grammar another approach for determining meaning is to ask callers to describe a problem in their own words,5,2,1,TRAIN
1010,This approach often begins by offering callers an open ended prompt such as “how may I help you ” Callers respond by describing in their own words why they are calling perhaps by saying “there’s a strange charge on my credit card statement”,7,5,1,TRAIN
1011,The system then uses sophisticated statistical modeling to identify key phrases and look for a match in a list of example phrases that have known meanings,5,3,1,TRAIN
1012,In this case the likely meaning would be associated with billing even though the word ‘billing’ was never spoken,6,2,1,TRAIN
1013,SmartListener™ technology increases automation by interpreting the meaning of caller responses that include filler phrases that do not exactly match expected dialogs,2,3,1,TRAIN
1014,White PaperCustomer Service Solutions Natural language understanding4 Although developing the detailed statistical models involves manual efforts to define and assign the agreed upon meanings to each transcription the result is very high automation rates and high customer satisfaction,6,4,1,TRAIN
1015,The key to extracting the correct meaning from this open ended approach is the proper tagging of previously transcribed phrases,1,4,1,TRAIN
1016,As with grammars if the caller gives a completely unexpected response like talking about ‘pizza toppings’ to an electricity provider’s system there will not be a match,7,3,1,TRAIN
1017,When there is no match the system will offer a fall back alternative that uses traditional grammars to determine the caller’s intent such as “I’m sorry I did not get that would you like mortgages credit cards …” Experience has shown that applying the keyword spotting approach to these fall back grammars often leads to a successful interaction,10,6,1,TRAIN
1018,Appropriate for determining the meaning of any open ended response this powerful approach is highly effective for call routing applications,4,1,1,TRAIN
1019,When callers use their own words there tends to be drastically fewer zero outs and misroutes as complicated menus are bypassed and confusing or arcane jargon is avoided,2,5,1,TRAIN
1020,Provide a more flexible script Accurately recognizing the meaning of what a caller says is only part of how natural language can improve automation,5,3,1,TRAIN
1021,The next step in learning to speak customer ese is for the self service system to have a conversation with the caller,5,1,1,TRAIN
1022,The conversational approach relies on dialogs that continuously adapt to the information provided,2,2,1,TRAIN
1023,This way the caller has a personalized experience while they control the conversation,5,1,1,TRAIN
1024,For example callers often provide more information than prompted for,2,2,1,TRAIN
1025,A system that can respond to varying amounts of information will have more productive and shorter calls,4,1,1,TRAIN
1026,Notice in the dialog at the right the caller provides the ‘extra’ information of the return date allowing the system to avoid having to ask for it,8,2,1,TRAIN
1027,More than collecting information a natural language conversation needs to flow smoothly,3,2,1,TRAIN
1028,A system that constantly asks for confirmations creates a disjointed conversation that callers tend to reject,3,3,1,TRAIN
1029,However systems that can handle corrections and verifications by dynamically embedding the confir mations in the next prompt are more engaging leading to better automation rates,2,3,1,TRAIN
1030,Notice in the dialog below how the system confirms the change to Boston when the caller requests a window seat,4,3,1,TRAIN
1031,Natural Language Understanding technology increases automation by correctly interpreting the meaning behind open ended caller responses allowing callers to use their own words rather than words chosen for them,2,5,1,TRAIN
1032,White PaperCustomer Service Solutions Natural language understanding5 Natural Language Understanding Directed Dialogue or DTMF Method Only Requires Pre Defined Menu Tree I lost my card and need another one,1,2,1,TRAIN
1033,Replacement Card Conversational dialogs can build in confirmations without having to explicitly ask for them CALLER No not Austin Boston,0,1,0,TRAIN

1035,Would you like to fly to Austin,0,2,0,TRAIN
1036,SYSTEM Okay do you prefer a window or aisle seat to Boston,2,1,1,TRAIN
1037,Conversational dialogs can handle more than one piece of information Natural Language Understanding Caller provides responses the way they want to and the system accepts and interprets the information,4,4,1,TRAIN
1038,AIRLINE SYSTEM with Natural Language Understanding Information to Collect Departure City Departure Date Number of Adults Number of Children Return City Return Date Seating Assignments CALLER On Wednesday and returning on Friday,1,1,1,TRAIN
1039,What day are you leaving,1,1,1,TRAIN
1040,SYSTEM � � � � � � � � � White PaperCustomer Service Solutions Natural language understanding6 This dialog flexibility is controlled by rules designed into prompts themselves so the system can respond and guide callers rather than dictate to them,7,3,1,TRAIN
1041,Perhaps the defining characteristic of a natural language experience is engaging callers with intuitive and direct conversations,2,2,1,TRAIN
1042,Conclusion In challenging economic conditions the importance of cost savings can not be underestimated,1,1,1,TRAIN
1043,By applying effective natural language techniques to a speech enabled self service IVR system automation rates will increase lead ing directly to lower costs,3,3,1,TRAIN
1044,This paper has shown that different approaches to natural language can be applied throughout the caller’s interaction to achieve these improved automation rates,5,3,1,TRAIN
1045,The three complementary natural language approaches of increasing the recognition accuracy within and around grammars allowing callers to give open ended responses and interacting with adaptive dialogs all lead to more efficient and appealing calls,3,6,1,TRAIN

1187,3 TIPS FOR YOUR PROJECT 3 KEY TAKEAWAYS 4 TO LEARN MORE 4 1 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that allows a computer application to understand human language either spoken or written,7,3,1,TRAIN
1188,The concept of NLP encompasses coding understanding interpreting and manipulating human language,2,3,1,TRAIN
1189,NLP applications use computers to translate languages convert voice to text and text to voice and create human like conversational agents to help customers employees and others deal with issues questions and concerns,4,3,1,TRAIN
1190,In recent years the field of NLP has been transformed by the shift from statistical machine learning methods to the use of neural networks and deep learning,2,2,1,TRAIN
1191,With these new approaches it is now possible to build automated systems that can interact with people more naturally than ever before,1,1,1,TRAIN
1192,And forward looking businesses are seizing the day incorporating NLP into a wide range of their processes for both customer facing activities and internal operations,2,3,1,TRAIN
1193,To help organizations capitalize on this trend Dell Technologies has an active research program focused on advancing the technologies and methodologies for the development of NLP applications,5,2,1,TRAIN
1194,This research is carried out by a data sciences team in the Dell Technologies HPC AI Innovation Lab in Austin Texas,2,1,1,TRAIN
1195,The lab currently has two key projects under way in this realm,2,0,0,TRAIN
1196,One focuses on language to language translation and the other focuses on text to voice translation,3,1,1,TRAIN
1197,LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE TRANSLATION In the lab’s research project focused on language to language translation our data scientists are working to solve key problems associated with translating from one human language to another using a neural network,7,4,1,TRAIN
1198,This is a process that involves taking inputs from a source language and converting it to a target language,4,2,1,TRAIN
1199,In this process the translation model first reads a sentence in a source language and then passes it to an encoder which builds an intermediate representation,7,2,1,TRAIN
1200,This intermediate representation is then passed to a decoder which processes the intermediate representation to produce the translated sentence in the target language,6,3,1,TRAIN
1201,For our language to language translation project we started with a stock topology created by Google and then improved some of the underlying mathematics so we could parallelize the workflows more efficiently,4,4,1,TRAIN
1202,Our goal was to run our model on hundreds of compute nodes at the same time to get to a solution more quickly,3,3,1,TRAIN
1203,In this optimization process which spanned several months our team looked at how the system was using memory how the system was performing computation and how we could improve certain parts of the system,6,5,1,TRAIN
1204,We then ran tests to make sure the model we got in the end was just as accurate as what Google could achieve,3,3,1,TRAIN
1205,This validation of the accuracy of the model gave us the assurance that in our efforts to speed up the computation we didn’t end up with lower quality answers,8,1,1,TRAIN
1206,2 DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHITE PAPER COMPUTING RESOURCES For this project our research team used Dell EMC systems with 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors in the Zenith supercomputer one of three HPC clusters in our HPC AI Innovation Lab,4,1,1,TRAIN
1207,This TOP500 system which resulted from a partnership between Dell Technologies and Intel serves as a benchmarking system for internal teams as well as a showcase resource for evaluations,3,3,1,TRAIN
1208,In addition the team leveraged the processing power of the Stampede2 supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC at The University of Texas at Austin,4,1,1,TRAIN
1209,This Intel based system ranked in the TOP500 list serves as a strategic national resource that provides HPC capabilities to thousands of researchers across the United States,3,3,1,TRAIN
1210,RESULTS In this project we demonstrated that the process of training models for language to language translation could be scaled to an extreme level — up to 512 nodes — without impacts on the quality of the results,6,3,1,TRAIN
1211,This result suggests that these models can now be trained at a much faster pace and at a much large scale without breaking the current state of the art,5,3,1,TRAIN
1212,TEXT TO VOICE TRANSLATION Text to voice translation takes written words and converts them to audio,2,1,1,TRAIN
1213,The objective is to generate a complete audio wave form synthetically — while not using the mechanized clip recordings that we have been used to hearing on telephone systems for the last 20 years,6,2,1,TRAIN
1214,With these more advanced approaches developers use training data that consists of a transcript and clips of a voice actor reading that transcript,3,3,1,TRAIN
1215,These resources serve as the training foundation for the creation of a voice that a computer will mimic,5,1,1,TRAIN
1216,The developers then train the neural network to produce a voice that sounds extremely similar to the actor’s voice although it’s not that person speaking,6,2,1,TRAIN
1217,It’s a neural network creating that voice completely from scratch,3,1,1,TRAIN
1218,About the lab The Dell Technologies HPC AI Innovation Lab encompasses a 13 000 square foot data center in Austin Texas devoted to high performance computing and artificial intelligence AI,5,3,1,TRAIN
1219,It houses thousands of servers a TOP500 cluster and a wide range of storage and network systems,4,0,0,TRAIN
1220,In addition to providing access to world class infrastructure the lab brings together HPC operational excellence and expertise,7,2,1,TRAIN

1224,This spectrogram image is a frequency distribution of the letters and sounds that are expected to be produced in the resulting voice,4,2,1,TRAIN
1225,• We then created a second model that takes the spectrogram and generates a complete audio waveform that uses a completely synthetic voice that pretends to be the voice actor that was used in the training process,7,4,1,TRAIN
1226,Again we’re not just stitching together voice clips of an actor talking,2,2,1,TRAIN
1227,We’re creating a synthetic voice that sounds a lot like the original,3,2,1,TRAIN
1228,In this ongoing project we are now working to accelerate the process of producing the audio waveforms,2,3,1,TRAIN

1287,However state of the art Open IE systems such as REVERB and WOE share two important weaknesses 1 they extract only relations that are medi ated by verbs and 2 they ignore context thus extracting tuples that are not asserted as factual,4,4,1,TRAIN
1288,This paper presents OLLIE a sub stantially improved Open IE system that ad dresses both these limitations,2,1,1,TRAIN
1289,First OLLIE achieves high yield by extracting relations me diated by nouns adjectives and more,1,3,1,TRAIN
1290,Sec ond a context analysis step increases preci sion by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions,5,2,1,TRAIN
1291,OLLIE obtains 2 7 times the area under precision yield curve AUC compared to REVERB and 1 9 times the AUC of WOEparse,2,2,1,TRAIN
1292,1 Introduction While traditional Information Extraction IE ARPA 1991 ARPA 1998 focused on identifying and extracting specific relations of interest there has been great interest in scaling IE to a broader set of relations and to far larger corpora Banko et al 2007 Hoffmann et al 2010 Mintz et al 2009 Carlson et al 2010 Fader et al 2011,5,2,1,TRAIN
1293,However the requirement of having pre specified relations of interest is a significant obstacle,2,0,0,TRAIN

1301,For sentences 4 5 REVERB and WOEparse have an incorrect extraction by ignoring the context that OLLIE explicitly represents,1,2,1,TRAIN
1302,analyzing their corpus is the discovery of important relations which are likely not pre specified,2,1,1,TRAIN
1303,Open IE Banko et al 2007 is the state of the art approach for such scenarios,1,0,0,TRAIN
1304,However the state of the art Open IE systems REVERB Fader et al 2011 Etzioni et al 2011 and WOEparse Wu and Weld 2010 suffer from two key drawbacks,0,1,0,TRAIN
1305,Firstly they handle a limited sub set of sentence constructions for expressing relation ships,2,2,1,TRAIN
1306,Both extract only relations that are mediated by verbs and REVERB further restricts this to a sub set of verbal patterns,3,2,1,TRAIN
1307,This misses important infor mation mediated via other syntactic entities such as nouns and adjectives as well as a wider range of verbal structures examples 1 3 in Figure 1,2,2,1,TRAIN
1308,Secondly REVERB and WOEparse perform only a local analysis of a sentence so they often extract relations that are not asserted as factual in the sen tence examples 4 5,3,2,1,TRAIN
1309,This often occurs when the relation is within a belief attribution hypothetical or other conditional context,4,1,1,TRAIN
1310,In this paper we present OLLIE Open Language Learning for Information Extraction 1 our novel Open IE system that overcomes the limitations of previous Open IE by 1 expanding the syntactic scope of relation phrases to cover a much larger number of relation expressions and 2 expand ing the Open IE representation to allow additional context information such as attribution and clausal modifiers,12,4,1,TRAIN
1311,OLLIE extractions obtain a dramatically higher yield at higher or comparable precision rela tive to existing systems,2,2,1,TRAIN
1312,The outline of the paper is as follows,1,1,1,TRAIN
1313,First we provide background on Open IE and how it relates to Semantic Role Labeling SRL,0,2,0,TRAIN
1314,Section 3 de scribes the syntactic scope expansion component which is based on a novel approach that learns open pattern templates,6,2,1,TRAIN
1315,These are relation independent dependency parse tree patterns that are automati cally learned using a novel bootstrapped training set,4,2,1,TRAIN
1316,Section 4 discusses the context analysis component which is based on supervised training with linguistic and lexical features,3,2,1,TRAIN
1317,Section 5 compares OLLIE with REVERB and WOEparse on a dataset from three domains News Wikipedia and a Biology textbook,2,2,1,TRAIN
1318,We find that OLLIE obtains 2 7 times the area in precision yield curves AUC as REVERB and 1 9 times the AUC as WOEparse,1,3,1,TRAIN
1319,Moreover for specific relations com monly mediated by nouns e g ‘is the president of’ OLLIE obtains two order of magnitude higher yield,3,2,1,TRAIN
1320,We also compare OLLIE to a state of the art SRL system Johansson and Nugues 2008 on an IE related end task and find that they both have com parable performance at argument identification and have complimentary strengths in sentence analysis,9,1,1,TRAIN
1321,In Section 6 we discuss related work on pattern based relation extraction,6,2,1,TRAIN
1322,2 Background Open IE systems extract tuples consisting of argu ment phrases from the input sentence and a phrase 1Available for download at http openie cs washington edu from the sentence that expresses a relation between the arguments in the format arg1 rel arg2,8,2,1,TRAIN
1323,This is done without a pre specified set of relations and with no domain specific knowledge engineering,3,1,1,TRAIN
1324,We compare OLLIE to two state of the art Open IE sys tems 1 REVERB Fader et al 2011 which uses shallow syntactic processing to identify rela tion phrases that begin with a verb and occur be tween the argument phrases 2 2 WOEparse Wu and Weld 2010 which uses bootstrapping from en tries in Wikipedia info boxes to learn extraction pat terns in dependency parses,7,4,1,TRAIN
1325,Like REVERB the relation phrases begin with verbs but can handle long range dependencies and relation phrases that do not come between the arguments,1,3,1,TRAIN
1326,Unlike RE VERB WOE does not include nouns within the re lation phrases e g cannot represent ‘is the presi dent of’ relation phrase,1,1,1,TRAIN
1327,Both systems ignore con text around the extracted relations that may indi cate whether it is a supposition or conditionally true rather than asserted as factual see 4 5 in Figure 1,3,3,1,TRAIN
1328,The task of Semantic role labeling is to identify arguments of verbs in a sentence and then to clas sify the arguments by mapping the verb to a se mantic frame and mapping the argument phrases to roles in that frame such as agent patient instru ment or benefactive,10,2,1,TRAIN
1329,SRL systems can also identify and classify arguments of relations that are mediated by nouns when trained on NomBank annotations,0,3,0,TRAIN
1330,Where SRL begins with a verb or noun and then looks for arguments that play roles with respect to that verb or noun Open IE looks for a phrase that ex presses a relation between a pair of arguments,3,5,1,TRAIN
1331,That phrase is often more than simply a single verb such as the phrase ‘plays a role in’ or ‘is the CEO of’,4,1,1,TRAIN
1332,3 Relational Extraction in OLLIE Figure 2 illustrates OLLIE’s architecture for learning and applying binary extraction patterns,2,2,1,TRAIN
1333,First it uses a set of high precision seed tuples from REVERB to bootstrap a large training set,5,2,1,TRAIN
1334,Second it learns open pattern templates over this training set,2,2,1,TRAIN
1335,Next OLLIE applies these pattern templates at extraction time,2,1,1,TRAIN
1336,This section describes these three steps in detail,2,0,0,TRAIN
1337,Fi nally OLLIE analyzes the context around the tuple Section 4 to add information attribution clausal modifiers and a confidence function,5,2,1,TRAIN

1339,Tuples Extraction Learning Figure 2 System architecture OLLIE begins with seed tuples from REVERB uses them to build a bootstrap training set and learns open pattern templates,6,5,1,TRAIN
1340,These are applied to individual sentences at extraction time,2,1,1,TRAIN
1341,3 1 Constructing a Bootstrapping Set Our goal is to automatically create a large training set which encapsulates the multitudes of ways in which information is expressed in text,5,4,1,TRAIN
1342,The key ob servation is that almost every relation can also be ex pressed via a REVERB style verb based expression,3,0,0,TRAIN
1343,So bootstrapping sentences based on REVERB’s tu ples will likely capture all relation expressions,3,2,1,TRAIN
1344,We start with over 110 000 seed tuples these are high confidence REVERB extractions from a large Web corpus ClueWeb 3 that are asserted at least twice and contain only proper nouns in the argu ments,3,2,1,TRAIN
1345,These restrictions reduce ambiguity while still covering a broad range of relations,2,2,1,TRAIN
1346,For ex ample a seed tuple may be Paul Annacone is the coach of Federer that REVERB extracts from the sentence “Paul Annacone is the coach of Federer ” For each seed tuple we retrieve all sentences in a Web corpus that contains all content words in the tuple,7,3,1,TRAIN
1347,We obtain a total of 18 million sentences,0,1,0,TRAIN
1348,For our example we will retrieve all sentences that contain ‘Federer’ ‘Paul’ ‘Annacone’ and some syn tactic variation of ‘coach’,4,2,1,TRAIN
1349,We may find sentences like “Now coached by Annacone Federer is win ning more titles than ever ” Our bootstrapping hypothesis assumes that all these sentences express the information of the orig inal seed tuple,5,5,1,TRAIN
1350,This hypothesis is not always true,1,0,0,TRAIN
1351,As an example for a seed tuple Boyle is born in Ireland we may retrieve a sentence “Felix G Whar ton was born in Donegal in the northwest of Ireland a county where the Boyles did their schooling ” 3http lemurproject org clueweb09 php To reduce bootstrapping errors we enforce addi tional dependency restrictions on the sentences,8,5,1,TRAIN
1352,We only allow sentences where the content words from arguments and relation can be linked to each other via a linear path of size four in the dependency parse,5,1,1,TRAIN
1353,To implement this restriction we only use the sub set of content words that are headwords in the parse tree,4,1,1,TRAIN
1354,In the above sentence ‘Ireland’ ‘Boyle’ and ‘born’ connect via a dependency path of length six and hence this sentence is rejected from the training set,8,2,1,TRAIN
1355,This reduces our set to 4 million seed tuple sentence pairs,1,1,1,TRAIN
1356,In our implementation we use Malt Dependency Parser Nivre and Nilsson 2004 for dependency parsing since it is fast and hence easily applica ble to a large corpus of sentences,6,0,0,TRAIN
1357,We post process the parses using Stanford’s CCprocessed algorithm which compacts the parse structure for easier extrac tion de Marneffe et al 2006,3,3,1,TRAIN
1358,We randomly sampled 100 sentences from our bootstrapping set and found that 90 of them sat isfy our bootstrapping hypothesis 64 without de pendency constraints,3,3,1,TRAIN
1359,We find this quality to be sat isfactory for our needs of learning general patterns,1,2,1,TRAIN
1360,Bootstrapped data has been previously used to generate positive training data for IE Hoffmann et al 2010 Mintz et al 2009,1,1,1,TRAIN
1361,However previous systems retrieved sentences that only matched the two arguments which is error prone since multiple relations can hold between a pair of entities e g Bill Gates is the CEO of a co founder of and has a high stake in Microsoft,2,3,1,TRAIN
1362,Alternatively researchers have developed sophis ticated probabilistic models to alleviate the effect of noisy data Riedel et al 2010 Hoffmann et al 2011,2,3,1,TRAIN
1363,In our case by enforcing that a sentence ad ditionally contains some syntactic form of the rela tion content words our bootstrapping set is naturally much cleaner,6,3,1,TRAIN
1364,Moreover this form of bootstrapping is better suited for Open IE’s needs as we will use this data to generalize to other unseen relations,4,1,1,TRAIN
1365,Since the relation words in the sentence and seed match we can learn general pattern templates that may apply to other relations too,5,1,1,TRAIN
1366,We discuss this process next,2,0,0,TRAIN
1367,3 2 Open Pattern Learning OLLIE’s next step is to learn general patterns that encode various ways of expressing relations,1,2,1,TRAIN
1368,OL Extraction Template Open Pattern 1,0,0,0,TRAIN

1374,Notice that some patterns 1 3 are purely syntactic and others are seman tic lexically constrained in bold font,0,2,0,TRAIN
1375,A dependency parse that matches pattern 1 is shown in Figure 4,3,2,1,TRAIN
1376,LIE learns open pattern templates a mapping from a dependency path to an open extraction i e one that identifies both the arguments and the exact REVERB style relation phrase,6,4,1,TRAIN
1377,Figure 3 gives ex amples of high frequency pattern templates learned by OLLIE,3,2,1,TRAIN
1378,Note that some of the dependency paths are completely unlexicalized 1 3 whereas in other cases some nodes have lexical or semantic restrictions 4 5,2,0,0,TRAIN
1379,Open pattern templates encode the ways in which a relation in the first column may be expressed in a sentence second column,3,3,1,TRAIN
1380,For example a relation Godse kill Gandhi may be expressed with a dependency path 2 Godse ↑nsubj↑ kill postag VBD ↓dobj↓ Gandhi,4,1,1,TRAIN
1381,To learn the pattern templates we first extract the dependency path connecting the arguments and re lation words for each seed tuple and the associated sentence,8,1,1,TRAIN
1382,We annotate the relation node in the path with the exact relation word as a lexical constraint and the POS postag constraint,4,0,0,TRAIN
1383,We create a re lation template from the seed tuple by normalizing ‘is’ ‘was’ ‘will be’ to ‘be’ and replacing the rela tion content word with rel 4 If the dependency path has a node that is not part of the seed tuple we call it a slot node,12,4,1,TRAIN
1384,Intuitively if slot words do not negate the tuple they can be skipped over,3,1,1,TRAIN
1385,As an example ‘hired’ is a slot word for the tuple Annacone is the coach of Federer in the sentence “Federer hired Annacone as a coach”,7,1,1,TRAIN
1386,We associate postag and lexical constraints with the slot node as well,2,0,0,TRAIN
1387,see 5 in Figure 3,0,0,0,TRAIN
1388,Next we perform several syntactic checks on each candidate pattern,1,1,1,TRAIN
1389,These checks are the con straints that we found to hold in very general pat terns which we can safely generalize to other un seen relations,0,3,0,TRAIN
1390,The checks are 1 There are no slot 4Our current implementation only allows a single relation content word extending to multiple words is straightforward the templates will require rel1 rel2,7,4,1,TRAIN
1391,,0,0,0,TRAIN
1392,,0,0,0,TRAIN
1393,nodes in the path,1,0,0,TRAIN
1394,2 The relation node is in the middle of arg1 and arg2,3,0,0,TRAIN
1395,3 The preposition e g if any in the pattern matches the preposition in the relation,3,0,0,TRAIN
1396,4 The path has no nn or amod edges,2,0,0,TRAIN
1397,If the checks hold true we accept it as a purely syntactic pattern with no lexical constraints,1,2,1,TRAIN
1398,Oth ers are semantic lexical patterns and require further constraints to be reliable as extraction patterns,1,1,1,TRAIN
1399,3 2 1 Purely Syntactic Patterns For syntactic patterns we aggressively general ize to unseen relations and prepositions,1,0,0,TRAIN
1400,We remove all lexical restrictions from the relation nodes,1,1,1,TRAIN
1401,We convert all preposition edges to an abstract prep ∗ edge,2,1,1,TRAIN
1402,We also replace the specific prepositions in extraction templates with prep,1,2,1,TRAIN
1403,As an example consider the sentences “Michael Webb appeared on Oprah ” and “ when Alexan der the Great advanced to Babylon ” and associ ated seed tuples Michael Webb appear on Oprah and Alexander advance to Babylon,6,4,1,TRAIN
1404,Both these data points return the same open pattern after gen eralization “ arg1 ↑nsubj↑ rel postag VBD ↓ prep ∗ ↓ arg2 ” with the extraction template arg1 rel prep arg2,5,1,1,TRAIN
1405,Other examples of syn tactic pattern templates are 1 3 in Figure 3,2,0,0,TRAIN
1406,3 2 2 Semantic Lexical Patterns Patterns that do not satisfy the checks are not as general as those that do but are still important,1,0,0,TRAIN
1407,Con structions like “Microsoft co founder Bill Gates ” work for some relation words e g founder CEO director president etc,3,0,0,TRAIN
1408,but would not work for other nouns for instance from “Chicago Symphony Orchestra” we should not conclude that Orchestra is the Symphony of Chicago,2,1,1,TRAIN
1409,Similarly we may conclude Annacone is the coach of Federer from the sentence “Federer hired Annacone as a coach ” but this depends on the se mantics of the slot word ‘hired’,4,3,1,TRAIN
1410,If we replaced ‘hired’ by ‘fired’ or ‘considered’ then the extraction would be false,1,5,1,TRAIN
1411,To enable such patterns we retain the lexical con straints on the relation words and slot words 5 We collect all patterns together based only on the syn tactic restrictions and convert the lexical constraint into a list of words with which the pattern was seen,6,6,1,TRAIN
1412,Example 5 in Figure 3 shows one such lexical list,2,1,1,TRAIN
1413,Can we generalize these lexically annotated pat terns further,0,1,0,TRAIN
1414,Our insight is that we can generalize a list of lexical items to other similar words,0,0,0,TRAIN
1415,For example if we see a list like CEO director presi dent founder then we should be able to generalize to ‘chairman’ or ‘minister’,6,1,1,TRAIN
1416,Several ways to compute semantically similar words have been suggested in the literature like Wordnet based distributional similarity etc,2,2,1,TRAIN
1417,e g Resnik 1996 Dagan et al 1999 Ritter et al 2010,0,0,0,TRAIN
1418,For our proof of concept we use a simple overlap metric with two important Wordnet classes Person and Location,2,1,1,TRAIN
1419,We generalize to these types when our list has a high overlap 75 with hy ponyms of these classes,3,1,1,TRAIN
1420,If not we simply retain the original lexical list without generalization,2,1,1,TRAIN
1421,Example 4 in Figure 3 is a type generalized pattern,2,0,0,TRAIN
1422,We combine all syntactic and semantic patterns and sort in descending order based on frequency of occurrence in the training set,7,2,1,TRAIN
1423,This imposes a natural ranking on the patterns more frequent patterns are likely to give higher precision extractions,2,2,1,TRAIN
1424,3 3 Pattern Matching for Extraction We now describe how these open patterns are used to extract binary relations from a new sentence,1,2,1,TRAIN
1425,We first match the open patterns with the dependency parse of the sentence and identify the base nodes for arguments and relations,5,1,1,TRAIN
1426,We then expand these to convey all the information relevant to the extraction,3,1,1,TRAIN
1427,As an example consider the sentence “I learned that the 2012 Sasquatch music festival is scheduled for May 25th until May 28th ” Figure 4 illustrates the dependency parse,7,4,1,TRAIN
1428,To apply pattern 1 from Figure 3 we first match arg1 to ‘festival’ rel to ‘scheduled’ and arg2 to ‘25th’ with prep ‘for’,6,2,1,TRAIN
1429,However festi val be scheduled for 25th is not a very meaningful extraction,1,0,0,TRAIN
1430,We need to expand this further,2,0,0,TRAIN
1431,5For highest precision extractions we may also need seman tic constraints on the arguments,1,1,1,TRAIN
1432,In this work we increase our yield by ignoring the argument type constraints,2,2,1,TRAIN
1433,learned VBD I PRP scheduled VBN that IN festival NN is VBZ 25th NNP 28th NNP the DET Sasquatch NNP music NN May NNP 11 May NNP 14 2012 CD nsubj ccomp complm nsubjpass auxpass prep for prep until det num nn nn nn nn Figure 4 A sample dependency parse,19,1,1,TRAIN
1434,The col ored greyed nodes represent all words that are extracted from the pattern arg1 ↑nsubjpass↑ rel postag VBN ↓ prep ∗ ↓ arg2,0,2,0,TRAIN
1435,The extraction is the 2012 Sasquatch Music Festival is scheduled for May 25th,1,0,0,TRAIN
1436,For the arguments we expand on amod nn det neg prep of num quantmod edges to build the noun phrase,5,2,1,TRAIN
1437,When the base noun is not a proper noun we also expand on rcmod infmod partmod ref prepc of edges since these are relative clauses that convey important information,7,2,1,TRAIN
1438,For relation phrases we expand on advmod mod aux auxpass cop prt edges,7,1,1,TRAIN
1439,We also include dobj and iobj in the case that they are not in an argument,2,1,1,TRAIN
1440,After identi fying the words in arg relation we choose their order as in the original sentence,4,0,0,TRAIN
1441,For example these rules will result in the extraction the Sasquatch music fes tival be scheduled for May 25th,2,1,1,TRAIN
1442,3 4 Comparison with WOEparse OLLIE’s algorithm is similar to that of WOEparse both systems follow the basic structure of boot strap learning of patterns based on dependency parse paths,3,4,1,TRAIN
1443,However there are three significant differ ences,0,0,0,TRAIN
1444,WOE uses Wikipedia based bootstrapping finding a sentence in a Wikipedia article that con tains the infobox values,4,2,1,TRAIN
1445,Since WOE does not have access to a seed relation phrase it heuristically as signs all intervening words between the arguments in the parse as the relation phrase,5,1,1,TRAIN
1446,This often results in under specified or nonsensical relation phrases,1,0,0,TRAIN
1447,For example from the sentence “David Miscavige learned that after Tom Cruise divorced Mimi Rogers he was pursuing Nicole Kidman ” WOE’s heuristics will extract the relation divorced was pursuing be tween ‘Tom Cruise’ and ‘Nicole Kidman’,5,4,1,TRAIN
1448,OLLIE in contrast produces well formed relation phrases by basing its templates on REVERB relation phrases,3,2,1,TRAIN
1449,Secondly WOE does not assign semantic lexical restrictions to its patterns and thus has lower preci sion due to aggressive syntactic generalization,2,1,1,TRAIN
1450,Fi nally WOE is designed to have verb mediated rela tion phrases that do not include nouns thus missing important relations such as ‘is the president of’,2,4,1,TRAIN
1451,In our experiments see Figure 5 we find WOEparse to have lower precision and yield than OLLIE,2,1,1,TRAIN
1452,4 Context Analysis in OLLIE We now turn to the context analysis component which handles the problem of extractions that are not asserted as factual in the text,4,3,1,TRAIN
1453,In some cases OLLIE can handle this by extending the tuple representation with an extra field that turns an otherwise incorrect tuple into a correct one,3,3,1,TRAIN
1454,In other cases there is no re liable way to salvage the extraction and OLLIE can avoid an error by giving the tuple a low confidence,5,2,1,TRAIN
1455,Cases where OLLIE extends the tuple representa tion include conditional truth and attribution,3,2,1,TRAIN
1456,Con sider sentence 4 in Figure 1,3,0,0,TRAIN
1457,It is not asserting that the earth is the center of the universe,3,1,1,TRAIN
1458,OLLIE adds an AttributedTo field which makes the final extrac tion valid see OLLIE extraction in Figure 1,3,2,1,TRAIN
1459,This field indicates who said suggested believes hopes or doubts the information in the main extraction,3,3,1,TRAIN
1460,Another case is when the extraction is only condi tionally true,2,0,0,TRAIN
1461,Sentence 5 in Figure 1 does not assert as factual that Romney will be elected President so it is an incorrect extraction,3,0,0,TRAIN
1462,However adding a condition “if he wins five states” can turn this into a correct extraction,2,2,1,TRAIN
1463,We extend OLLIE to have a ClausalModifier field when there is a dependent clause that modifies the main extraction,4,1,1,TRAIN
1464,Our approach for extracting these additional fields makes use of the dependency parse structure,5,2,1,TRAIN
1465,We find that attributions are marked by a ccomp clausal complement edge,2,2,1,TRAIN
1466,For example in the parse of sen tence 4 there is a ccomp e g between ‘believe’ and ‘center’,5,2,1,TRAIN
1467,Our algorithm first checks for the pres ence of a ccomp e g to the relation node,5,1,1,TRAIN
1468,However not all ccomp edges are attributions,0,0,0,TRAIN
1469,We match the context verb e g ‘believe’ with a list of commu nication and cognition verbs from VerbNet Schuler 2006 to detect attributions,7,0,0,TRAIN
1470,The context verb and its subject then populate the AttributedTo field,4,0,0,TRAIN
1471,Similarly the clausal modifiers are marked by ad vcl adverbial clause edge,2,1,1,TRAIN
1472,We filter these lexically and add a ClausalModifier field when the first word of the clause matches a list of 16 terms created using a training set if when although because,6,3,1,TRAIN
1473,OLLIE has high precision for AttributedTo and ClausalModifier fields nearly 98 on a develop ment set however these two fields do not cover all the cases where an extraction is not asserted as fac tual,4,2,1,TRAIN
1474,To handle others we train OLLIE’s confidence function to reduce the confidence of an extraction if its context indicates it is likely to be non factual,5,3,1,TRAIN
1475,We use a supervised logistic regression classifier for the confidence function,5,1,1,TRAIN
1476,Features include the frequency of the extraction pattern the presence of AttributedTo or ClausalModifier fields and the po sition of certain words in the extraction’s context such as function words or the communication and cognition verbs used for the AttributedTo field,10,2,1,TRAIN
1477,For example one highly predictive feature tests whether or not the word ‘if’ comes before the extraction when no ClausalModifier fields are attached,3,3,1,TRAIN
1478,Our training set was 1000 extractions drawn evenly from Wikipedia News and Biology sentences,2,1,1,TRAIN
1479,5 Experiments Our experiments evaluate three main questions,0,1,0,TRAIN
1480,1 How does OLLIE’s performance compare with exis ting state of the art open extractors,2,1,1,TRAIN
1481,2 What are the contributions of the different sub components within OLLIE,0,0,0,TRAIN
1482,3 How do OLLIE’s extractions com pare with semantic role labeling argument identifi cation,2,1,1,TRAIN
1483,5 1 Comparison of Open IE Systems Since Open IE is designed to handle a variety of domains we create a dataset of 300 random sen tences from three sources News Wikipedia and Bi ology textbook,3,2,1,TRAIN
1484,The News and Wikipedia test sets are a random subset of Wu and Weld’s test set for WOEparse,2,1,1,TRAIN
1485,We ran three systems OLLIE REVERB and WOEparse on this dataset resulting in a total of 1 945 extractions from all three systems,0,2,0,TRAIN
1486,Two an notators tagged the extractions as correct if the sen tence asserted or implied that the relation was true,2,3,1,TRAIN
1487,Inter annotator agreement was 0 96 and we retained the subset of extractions on which the two annotators agree for further analysis,2,2,1,TRAIN
1488,All systems associate a confidence value with an extraction ranking with these confidence values generates a precision yield curve for this dataset,5,3,1,TRAIN
1489,Figure 5 reports the curves for the three systems,1,0,0,TRAIN
1490,We find that OLLIE has a higher performance ow ing primarily to its higher yield at comparable preci 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 OLLIE ReVerb WOE Yield P re ci si o n parse Figure 5 Comparison of different Open IE systems,5,2,1,TRAIN
1491,OL LIE achieves substantially larger area under the curve than other Open IE systems,2,1,1,TRAIN
1492,sion,1,0,0,TRAIN
1493,OLLIE finds 4 4 times more correct extractions than REVERB and 4 8 times more than WOEparse at a precision of about 0 75,1,2,1,TRAIN
1494,Overall OLLIE has 2 7 times larger area under the curve than REVERB and 1 9 times larger than WOEparse 6 We use the Boot strap test Cohen 1995 to find that OLLIE’s better performance compared to the two systems is highly statistically significant,5,3,1,TRAIN
1495,We perform further analysis to understand the rea sons behind the high yield from OLLIE,4,1,1,TRAIN
1496,We find that 40 of the OLLIE extractions that REVERB misses are due to OLLIE’s use of parsers REVERB misses those because its shallow syntactic analysis cannot skip over the intervening clauses or prepositional phrases between the relation phrase and the argu ments,5,4,1,TRAIN
1497,About 30 of the additional yield is those extractions where the relation is not between its ar guments see instance 1 in Figure 1,2,1,1,TRAIN
1498,The rest are due to other causes such as OLLIE’s ability to handle relationships mediated by nouns and adjectives or REVERB’s shallow syntactic analysis etc,3,3,1,TRAIN
1499,In con trast OLLIE misses very few extractions returned by REVERB mostly due to parser errors,2,2,1,TRAIN
1500,We find that WOEparse misses extractions found by OLLIE for a variety of reasons,1,2,1,TRAIN
1501,The primary cause is that WOEparse does not include nouns in re lation phrases,2,1,1,TRAIN
1502,It also misses some verb based pat terns probably due to training noise,1,2,1,TRAIN
1503,In other cases WOEparse misses extractions due to ill formed rela tion phrases as in the example of Section 3 4 ‘di vorced was pursuing’ instead of the correct relation ‘was pursuing’,1,1,1,TRAIN
1504,While the bulk of OLLIE’s extractions in our test 6Evaluating recall is difficult at this scale however since yield is proportional to recall the area differences also hold for the equivalent precision recall curves,7,2,1,TRAIN
1505,Relation OLLIE REVERB incr,1,0,0,TRAIN

1507,WOEparse outputs no instances of these because it does not allow nouns in the relation,1,0,0,TRAIN
1508,These results are at point of maximum yield with comparable precisions around 0 66,1,1,1,TRAIN
1509,set were verb mediated our intuition suggests that there exist many relationships that are most natu rally expressed via noun phrases,2,3,1,TRAIN
1510,To demonstrate this effect we chose four such relations is capi tal of is president of is professor at and is scientist of,6,2,1,TRAIN
1511,We ran our systems on 100 million random sen tences from the ClueWeb corpus,2,0,0,TRAIN
1512,Figure 6 reports the yields of these four relations 7 OLLIE found up to 146 times as many extrac tions for these relations than REVERB,2,1,1,TRAIN
1513,Because WOEparse does not include nouns in relation phrases it is unable to extract any instance of these relations,2,1,1,TRAIN
1514,We examine a sample of the extractions to verify that noun mediated extractions are the main reason for this large yield boost over REVERB 73 of OLLIE extractions were noun mediated,4,1,1,TRAIN
1515,High frequency noun patterns like “Obama the president of the US” “Obama the US president” “US President Obama” far outnumber sentences of the form “Obama is the president of the US”,2,1,1,TRAIN
1516,These relations are seldom the primary information in a sentence and are typically mentioned in passing in noun phrases that express the relation,4,1,1,TRAIN
1517,For some applications noun mediated relations are important as they associate people with work places and job titles,1,1,1,TRAIN
1518,Overall we think of the results in Figure 6 as a “best case analysis” that illustrates the dramatic increase in yield for certain relations due to syntactic scope expansion in Open IE,7,3,1,TRAIN
1519,5 2 Analysis of OLLIE We perform two control experiments to understand the value of semantic lexical restrictions in pattern learning and precision boost due to context analysis component,7,3,1,TRAIN
1520,7We multiply the total number of extractions with precision on a sample for that relation to estimate the yield,5,1,1,TRAIN

1523,These pat terns without restrictions OLLIE syn result in low pre cision,2,0,0,TRAIN
1524,Type generalization improves yield compared to patterns with only lexical constraints OLLIE lex,2,2,1,TRAIN
1525,Are semantic restrictions important for open pat tern learning,2,0,0,TRAIN
1526,How much does type generalization help,3,0,0,TRAIN
1527,To answer these questions we compare three systems OLLIE without semantic or lexical restric tions OLLIE syn OLLIE with lexical restrictions but no type generalization OLLIE lex and the full system OLLIE,3,2,1,TRAIN
1528,We restrict this experiment to the patterns where OLLIE adds semantic lexical restric tions rather than dilute the result with patterns that would be unchanged by these variants,2,1,1,TRAIN
1529,Figure 7 shows the results of this experiment on our dataset from three domains,1,1,1,TRAIN
1530,As the curves show OLLIE was correct to add lexical semantic constraints to these patterns precision is quite low without the restrictions,1,4,1,TRAIN
1531,This matches our intuition since these are not completely general patterns and generalizing to all unseen relations results in a large number of errors,2,1,1,TRAIN
1532,OLLIE lex performs well though at lower yield,2,0,0,TRAIN
1533,The type generalization helps the yield somewhat without hurting the precision,2,3,1,TRAIN
1534,We believe that a more data driven type generalization that uses distributional similarity e g Ritter et al 2010 may help much more,3,3,1,TRAIN
1535,Also notice that over all precision numbers are lower since these are the more difficult relations to extract reliably,1,1,1,TRAIN
1536,We con clude that lexical semantic restrictions are valuable for good performance of OLLIE,2,0,0,TRAIN
1537,We also compare our full system to a version that does not use the context analysis of Section 4,5,1,1,TRAIN
1538,Fig ure 8 compares OLLIE to a version OLLIE pat that does not add the AttributedTo and ClausalModifier fields and instead of context sensitive confidence function uses the pattern frequency in the training 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 OLLIE OLLIE pat Yield P re ci si o n Figure 8 Context analysis increases precision raising the area under the curve by 19,13,6,1,TRAIN

1540,10 of the sentences have an OLLIE extraction with ClausalModifier and 6 have AttributedTo fields,2,0,0,TRAIN
1541,Adding ClausalModifier corrects errors for 21 of extractions that have a ClausalModifier and does not introduce any new er rors,1,3,1,TRAIN
1542,Adding AttributedTo corrects errors for 55 of the extractions with AttributedTo and introduces an error for 3 of the extractions,1,3,1,TRAIN
1543,Overall we find that OLLIE gives a significant boost to precision over OLLIE pat and obtains 19 additional AUC,5,3,1,TRAIN
1544,Finally we analyze the errors made by OLLIE,0,1,0,TRAIN
1545,Unsurprisingly because of OLLIE’s heavy reliance on the parsers parser errors account for a large part of OLLIE’s errors 32,3,1,1,TRAIN
1546,18 of the errors are due to aggressive generalization of a pattern to all un seen relations and 12 due to incorrect application of lexically annotated patterns,3,2,1,TRAIN
1547,About 14 of the er rors are due to important context missed by OLLIE,2,1,1,TRAIN
1548,Another 12 of the errors are because of the limita tions of binary representation which misses impor tant information that can only be expressed in n ary tuples,3,2,1,TRAIN
1549,We believe that as parsers become more robust OLLIE’s performance will improve even further,2,2,1,TRAIN
1550,The presence of context related errors suggests that there is more to investigate in context analysis,2,2,1,TRAIN
1551,Finally in the future we wish to extend the representation to include n ary extractions,2,1,1,TRAIN
1552,5 3 Comparison with SRL Our final evaluation suggests answers to two im portant questions,1,1,1,TRAIN
1553,First how does a state of the art Open IE system do in terms of absolute recall,2,1,1,TRAIN
1554,Sec ond how do Open IE systems compare against state of the art SRL systems,1,1,1,TRAIN
1555,SRL as discussed in Section 2 has a very dif ferent goal analyzing verbs and nouns to identify their arguments then mapping the verb or noun to a semantic frame and determining the role that each argument plays in that frame,8,6,1,TRAIN
1556,These verbs and nouns need not make the full relation phrase although re cent work has shown that they may be converted to Open IE style extractions with additional post processing Christensen et al 2011,7,4,1,TRAIN
1557,While a direct comparison between OLLIE and a full SRL system is problematic we can compare performance of OLLIE and the argument identifica tion step of an SRL system,6,0,0,TRAIN
1558,We set each system the following task “based on a sentence find all noun pairs that have an asserted relationship ” This task is permissive for both systems as it does not require finding an exact relation phrase or argument bound ary or determining the argument roles in a relation,8,6,1,TRAIN
1559,We create a gold standard by tagging a random 50 sentences of our test set to identify all pairs of NPs that have an asserted relation,5,3,1,TRAIN
1560,We only counted relation expressed by a verb or noun in the text and did not include relations expressed simply with “of” or apostrophe s Where a verb mediates between an argument and multiple NPs we represent this as a binary relation for all pairs of NPs,7,4,1,TRAIN
1561,For example the sentence “Macromolecules translocated through the phloem include proteins and various types of RNA that enter the sieve tubes through plasmodesmata ” has five binary relations,6,3,1,TRAIN
1562,arg1 arg2 relation term Macromolecules phloem translocated Macromolecules proteins include Macromolecules types of RNA include types of RNA sieve tubes enter types of RNA plasmodesmata enter We find an average of 4 0 verb mediated relations and 0 3 noun mediated relations per sentence,7,5,1,TRAIN
1563,Eval uating OLLIE against this gold standard helps to an swer the question of absolute recall what percent age of binary relations expressed in a sentence can our systems identify,7,2,1,TRAIN
1564,For comparison we use a state of the art SRL system from Lund University Johansson and Nugues 2008 which is trained on PropBank Martha and Palmer 2002 for its verb frames and NomBank Meyers et al 2004 for noun frames,2,2,1,TRAIN
1565,The PropBank version of the system won the very competitive 2008 CONLL SRL evaluation,3,0,0,TRAIN
1566,We conduct this experiment by manually compar LUND OLLIE union Verb relations 0 58 0 69 0 49 0 55 0 71 0 83 Noun relations 0 07 0 33 0 13 0 13 0 20 0 33 All relations 0 54 0 67 0 47 0 52 0 67 0 80 Figure 9 Recall of LUND and OLLIE on binary relations,5,0,0,TRAIN
1567,In parentheses is recall with oracle co reference,1,1,1,TRAIN
1568,Both systems identify approximately half of all argument pairs but have lower recall on noun mediated relations,2,1,1,TRAIN
1569,ing the outputs of LUND and OLLIE against the gold standard,1,1,1,TRAIN
1570,For each pair of NPs in the gold standard we determine whether the systems find a relation with that pair of NPs as arguments,5,1,1,TRAIN
1571,Recall is based on the percentage of NP pairs where the head nouns matches head nouns of two different arguments in an extraction or semantic frame,4,3,1,TRAIN
1572,If the argument value is conjunctive we count a match against the head noun of each item in the list,8,0,0,TRAIN
1573,We also count cases where system output would match the gold standard given perfect co reference,6,2,1,TRAIN
1574,Figure 9 shows the recall for OLLIE and LUND with recall based on oracle co referential matches in parentheses,2,2,1,TRAIN
1575,Our analysis shows strong recall for both systems for verb mediated relations LUND finding about two thirds of the argument pairs and OLLIE finding over half,2,2,1,TRAIN
1576,Both systems have low recall for noun mediated relations with most of LUND’s recall requiring co reference,1,1,1,TRAIN
1577,We observe that a union of the two systems raises recall to 0 71 for verb mediated relations and 0 83 with co reference demonstrating that each system is identi fying argument pairs that the other missed,5,3,1,TRAIN
1578,It is not surprising that OLLIE has recall of ap proximately 0 5 since it is tuned for high precision extraction and avoids less reliable extractions from constructions such as reduced relative clauses and gerunds or from noun mediated relations with long range dependencies,5,2,1,TRAIN
1579,In contrast SRL is tuned to identify the argument structure for nearly all verbs and nouns in a sentence,4,1,1,TRAIN
1580,The missing recall from SRL is primarily where it does not identify both ar guments of a binary relation or where the correct argument is buried in a long argument phrase but is not its head noun,7,3,1,TRAIN
1581,It is surprising that LUND trained on Nom Bank identifies so few noun mediated argument pairs without co reference,2,2,1,TRAIN
1582,An example will make this clear,1,1,1,TRAIN
1583,For the sentence “Clarcor a maker of packaging and filtration products said ” the tar get relation is between Clarcor and the products it makes,7,2,1,TRAIN
1584,LUND identifies a frame maker 01 in which argument A0 has head noun ‘maker’ and A1 is a PP headed by ‘products’ missing the actual name of the maker without co reference post processing,8,3,1,TRAIN
1585,OLLIE finds the extraction Clarcor be a maker of packag ing and filtration products where the heads of both arguments matched those of the target,2,2,1,TRAIN
1586,In another example LUND identifies “his” and “brother” as the arguments of the frame brother 01 rather than the actual names of the two brothers,4,1,1,TRAIN
1587,We can draw several conclusions from this exper iment,1,0,0,TRAIN
1588,First nouns although less frequently mediat ing relations are much harder and both systems are failing significantly on those OLLIE is somewhat better,1,1,1,TRAIN
1589,Two neither systems dominates the other in fact recall is increased significantly by a union of the two,3,2,1,TRAIN
1590,Three and probably most importantly significant information is still being missed by both systems and more research is warranted,2,2,1,TRAIN
1591,6 Related Work There is a long history of bootstrapping and pat tern learning approaches in traditional informa tion extraction e g DIPRE Brin 1998 Snow Ball Agichtein and Gravano 2000 Espresso Pan tel and Pennacchiotti 2006 PORE Wang et al 2007 SOFIE Suchanek et al 2009 NELL Carl son et al 2010 and PROSPERA Nakashole et al 2011,5,2,1,TRAIN

1593,Other approaches have extended these to learning patterns based on full syntactic analysis of a sentence Bunescu and Mooney 2005 Suchanek et al 2006 Zhao and Grishman 2005,2,2,1,TRAIN
1594,OLLIE has significant differences from the previ ous work in pattern learning,3,0,0,TRAIN
1595,First and most impor tantly these previous systems learn an extractor for each relation of interest whereas OLLIE is an open extractor,3,1,1,TRAIN
1596,OLLIE’s strength is its ability to gener alize from one relation to many other relations that are expressed in similar forms,4,1,1,TRAIN
1597,This happens both via syntactic generalization and type generalization of relation words sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2,4,0,0,TRAIN
1598,This ca pability is essential as many relations in the test set are not even seen in the training set in early exper iments we found that non generalized pattern learn ing equivalent to traditional IE had significantly less yield at a slightly higher precision,5,4,1,TRAIN
1599,Secondly previous systems begin with seeds that consist of a pair of entities whereas we also in clude the content words from REVERB relations in our training seeds,3,3,1,TRAIN
1600,This results in a much higher precision bootstrapping set and high rule preci sion while still allowing morphological variants that cover noun mediated relations,3,3,1,TRAIN
1601,A third difference is in the scale of the training REVERB yields millions of training seeds where previous systems had orders of magnitude less,3,2,1,TRAIN
1602,This enables OLLIE to learn pat terns with greater coverage,1,1,1,TRAIN
1603,The closest to our work is the pattern learning based open extractor WOEparse,3,1,1,TRAIN
1604,Section 3 4 de tails the differences between the two extractors,2,0,0,TRAIN
1605,An other extractor StatSnowBall Zhu et al 2009 has an Open IE version which learns general but shal low patterns,2,1,1,TRAIN
1606,Preemptive IE Shinyama and Sekine 2006 is a paradigm related to Open IE that first groups documents based on pairwise vector cluster ing then applies additional clustering to group en tities based on document clusters,5,4,1,TRAIN
1607,The clustering steps make it difficult for it to scale to large corpora,0,2,0,TRAIN
1608,7 Conclusions Our work describes OLLIE a novel Open IE ex tractor that makes two significant advances over the existing Open IE systems,2,2,1,TRAIN
1609,First it expands the syntactic scope of Open IE systems by identi fying relationships mediated by nouns and adjec tives,1,2,1,TRAIN
1610,Our experiments found that for some rela tions this increases the number of correct extrac tions by two orders of magnitude,1,3,1,TRAIN
1611,Second by an alyzing the context around an extraction OLLIE is able to identify cases where the relation is not as serted as factual but is hypothetical or conditionally true,3,2,1,TRAIN
1612,OLLIE increases precision by reducing con fidence in those extractions or by associating addi tional context in the extractions in the form of at tribution and clausal modifiers,5,4,1,TRAIN
1613,Overall OLLIE ob tains 1 9 to 2 7 times more area under precision yield curves compared to existing state of the art open extractors,2,1,1,TRAIN
1614,OLLIE is available for download at http openie cs washington edu,3,0,0,TRAIN

1780,According to Gartner artificial intelligence will generate $2 9 trillion USD in business value and recover 6 2 billion hours of worker productivity by 2021 2 To realize the high growth potential and costs savings from analytics and AI technology we must demystify some key artificial intelligence machine learning and analytics concepts,11,6,1,TRAIN

1860,This hierarchical pyramid explains the competencies every organization requires to ensure a successful AI implementation,3,3,1,TRAIN
1861,AI deep learning Machine learning and benchmarking A B testing experimentation BI or analytics Metrics segmentation aggregation data labelling Explore and transform Data preparation cleaning and exploratory data analysis Data flow Infrastructure pipelines ETL structured and unstructured data storage Data collection External data logging sensors user generated content AI deep learning Machine learning and benchmarking A B testing experimentation BI or analytics Metrics segmentation aggregation data labelling Explore and transform Data preparation cleaning and exploratory data analysis Data flow Infrastructure pipelines ETL structured and unstructured data storage Data collection External data logging sensors user generated content Data collection,14,6,1,TRAIN
1862,At the bottom of the pyramid is data collection,3,0,0,TRAIN
1863,At this stage the goal is to identify what data is needed and what is available,2,2,1,TRAIN
1864,If it is a user facing product are all relevant interactions logged,1,1,1,TRAIN
1865,If it is a sensor what data is coming through and how,1,1,1,TRAIN
1866,Without data no machine learning or AI solution can learn or predict outcomes,5,0,0,TRAIN
1867,Data flow,1,0,0,TRAIN
1868,Identify how the data flows through the system,2,0,0,TRAIN
1869,Is there a reliable stream ETL process established,2,1,1,TRAIN
1870,Where is the data stored and how easy is it to access and analyze,2,1,1,TRAIN
1871,Explore and transform,1,0,0,TRAIN
1872,Only when data is accessible can it be explored and transformed for modelling,1,1,1,TRAIN
1873,This stage is one of the most time consuming and underestimated of the data science project lifecycle,5,0,0,TRAIN
1874,It is at this stage that teams and organizations realize that they are missing data their machine sensors are unreliable they are not tracking relevant information about customers and other key issues,3,2,1,TRAIN
1875,It forces them to return to data collection and ensure the foundation is solid before moving forward,2,3,1,TRAIN
1876,“Not going to the top is like an insight engine working at half capacity not using all its potential ” 8 14Demystifying data science Business intelligence and analytics,6,3,1,TRAIN
1877,When teams can reliably explore and clean data organizations can start building what is traditionally thought of as business intelligence or analytics which includes defining key metrics to track identifying how seasonality impacts product sales and operations segmenting users based on demographic factors etc,5,7,1,TRAIN
1878,However as the goal is to build an artificial intelligence solution it is important to start thinking about the features or attributes to include in machine learning models what training data the machine will need to learn what to predict and automate and how to create the labels from which the machine will learn,10,5,1,TRAIN
1879,Label creation can be done automatically such as when the machine breaks down and it automatically registers an event in the back end system,5,1,1,TRAIN
1880,Or it can be done by introducing humans,1,1,1,TRAIN
1881,For example an engineer reports an issue when a machine part seems to be faulty during a routine inspection and the result is manually added to the data,6,3,1,TRAIN
1882,Machine learning and benchmarking,2,1,1,TRAIN
1883,Although there is sample data that can be used to make predictions work is not complete,3,1,1,TRAIN
1884,A B testing or experimentation framework needs to be in place to deploy models incrementally and avoid real world disasters,5,3,1,TRAIN
1885,Model validation and experimentation approaches provide a rough estimate of the effects of changes before practical implementation,4,1,1,TRAIN
1886,At this stage a very simple baseline or benchmark for performance tracking should be established,4,1,1,TRAIN
1887,An example fraud detection system includes monitoring high risk credit card transactions that were proved to be fraudulent and comparing them with the current operational performance of machine learning models to accurately detect fraud,10,4,1,TRAIN
1888,Artificial intelligence,1,0,0,TRAIN
1889,At this stage a team might be looking to make improvements in production,3,2,1,TRAIN

1893,Data science is a multi disciplinary field that uses scientific methods processes algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data,2,2,1,TRAIN
1894,Because there are a number of different techniques and methodologies it is often difficult to narrow down the scope of how data science can impact business performance operations customer experience and costs,8,0,0,TRAIN
1895,Here are just a few ways data science can be leveraged,1,1,1,TRAIN
1896,Augment employee decisions with data driven insights and intelligence Utilize subject matter experts’ knowledge of how employees make business decisions and transform the steps into data point applying machine learning techniques to identify the decision making pattern from this historical data to predict future business outcomes,9,8,1,TRAIN
1897,Organizations can design an intelligent system that can handle complex requests or tasks provide intelligent best fit decisions for individual scenarios and empower employees to make decisions quickly and more effectively,2,5,1,TRAIN
1898,Some example uses include credit risk scoring automated underwriting wealth management fund assistants and customer service chatbots,10,3,1,TRAIN
1899,Automate and improve the efficiency of operations with intelligent data driven decisions Leverage AI and analytics techniques to drive operational efficiency,2,2,1,TRAIN
1900,By utilizing sensor information from machines machine learning can help predict when a specific machine is likely to require maintenance allowing technicians to be proactive rather than reactive in maintenance efforts,10,3,1,TRAIN
1901,Some AI applications in this context include predictive maintenance recommender systems robotic process automation and airline scheduling,6,2,1,TRAIN
1902,Apply data driven insights to make timely and consequential tactical and strategic decisions Better inform management and strategic decisions by leveraging machine learning and advanced analytics,4,2,1,TRAIN
1903,These tend to be ad hoc projects or solutions where the goal is to apply statistical techniques to gain key insights around business processes,5,1,1,TRAIN
1904,For example by measuring analytics related to cleanliness customer service overall satisfaction etc an amusement park operations manager can determine the likelihood of repeat customers identify key gaps in operations and better market the value of the park to the right demographics,12,4,1,TRAIN
1905,Personalize customer experiences Identify and recommend personalized products at scale with recommender systems,2,2,1,TRAIN
1906,The likes of Google Amazon Facebook and Apple have made personalization an expectation,2,1,1,TRAIN
1907,Recommender systems are one of the more popular examples of how machine learning can be leveraged to analyze data across millions of users to accomplish this,2,2,1,TRAIN
1908,By analyzing and tracking various customer touchpoints some retailers are now able to predict the likelihood of users buying future products,2,2,1,TRAIN
1909,It is important to note that machine learning solutions need not be 100 percent accurate to realize business value and ROI,5,2,1,TRAIN
1910,The goal should be to conduct data driven decision making at scale to reduce operational costs and optimize resources and targeting efforts,3,4,1,TRAIN
1911,10 14Demystifying data science Utilize data driven insights and intelligence to accelerate new product development Convert massive amounts of big data into meaningful and actionable insights,5,2,1,TRAIN
1912,Voice assistants autopilot features and smart home devices have become part of day to day life,5,2,1,TRAIN
1913,This new class of AI driven products are powered by machine learning and advanced analytics techniques allowing organizations and teams to better understand consumer needs and wants feature requests and usage patterns,4,4,1,TRAIN
1914,Common techniques and methodologies in machine learning Machine learning takes what comes naturally to humans and applies it at scale,2,3,1,TRAIN
1915,For example when machine learning reviews a loan application it can review 5 000 credit transactions three credit reports 10 incidents the five year income history of Joe Adams in seconds,7,3,1,TRAIN
1916,This would not be possible by a domain expert,2,0,0,TRAIN
1917,They simply do not have the capacity to reviews with the speed of a machine and provide a decision on his loan as soon as it is submitted,4,3,1,TRAIN
1918,Even if the expert is highly experienced and efficient it takes considerable time to review application details and there is still room for human error,6,2,1,TRAIN
1919,Machine learning uses past experience and trends in historical data related to customers in both good standing and those that defaulted on loans to make a decision,4,3,1,TRAIN
1920,With the combination of machine learning and good quality data organizations can quickly make unbiased data driven decisions at scale in seconds,3,2,1,TRAIN
1921,Machine learning offers various approaches to solve business problems,2,2,1,TRAIN
1922,The first approach is based on whether there is data related to the outcome of a process,2,1,1,TRAIN
1923,Did the machine stop working,3,0,0,TRAIN
1924,Did the customer leave,2,0,0,TRAIN
1925,Did the employee quit,2,0,0,TRAIN
1926,It is important to understand and model how behavior and fluctuations in data lead to a certain business outcome,4,1,1,TRAIN
1927,This type of machine learning is known as supervised learning,3,1,1,TRAIN
1928,Machine learning Unsupervised learning Supervised learning • Data does not contain a category response to predict • The goal here is to learn about the underlying structure or distribution of the data and discover inherent patterns from within it in order to draw inferences • We know the outcome response • Takes known set of input data and responses to it and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new dataMachine learning Unsupervised learning • Data does not contain a category response to predict • The goal here is to learn about the underlying structure or distribution of the data and discover inherent patterns from within it in order to draw inferences Supervised learning • We know the outcome response • Takes known set of input data and responses to it and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data 11 14Demystifying data science If there is no response or category to predict the goal is to learn the underlying structure of the data and discover patterns to draw real world inferences,22,11,1,TRAIN
1929,For example unsupervised learning approaches are commonly used to segment customers based on demographic behavior and past product purchase history,5,3,1,TRAIN
1930,This allows an organization to learn more about their customers which products are frequently bought together and how different groups prefer certain services and products over others,2,2,1,TRAIN
1931,It may not immediately understand that Emily from Philadelphia falls within customer segment X but the organization can learn how many of its customers are similar to Emily based on behavior and consumption characteristics,4,4,1,TRAIN
1932,Are they active on mobile,1,0,0,TRAIN
1933,Do they use social media,1,0,0,TRAIN
1934,Do they visit retail stores for purchases,2,0,0,TRAIN
1935,Are they affluent,1,0,0,TRAIN
1936,These insights can allow organizations to make data driven decisions for future marketing campaigns product development etc,3,2,1,TRAIN
1937,Supervised learning Supervised learning can be broken down into two categories based on what it is trying to predict,2,3,1,TRAIN
1938,Supervised learning Classification categories Regression numbers Use if data can be tagged categorized or separated into specific groups or classes Use if the response being predicted is a real number Supervised learning Classification categories Regression numbers Use if data can be tagged categorized or separated into specific groups or classes Use if the response being predicted is a real number Classification algorithms or approaches are used when asking questions regarding categories,3,6,1,TRAIN
1939,Examples include • Will this customer switch to another competitor in the next month,4,1,1,TRAIN

1947,12 14Demystifying data science Unsupervised learning There are multiple unsupervised learning approaches and techniques that can be utilized to gain meaningful insights,4,2,1,TRAIN
1948,One of the more popular techniques is clustering which groups things that are similar or have features in common,0,1,0,TRAIN
1949,Organizations use clustering techniques to answer business questions such as • How many distinct customer groups exist for my products,2,3,1,TRAIN
1950,Who belongs to which group,1,0,0,TRAIN
1951,• To which customer subgroups should I market my product and how should I target them,5,0,0,TRAIN
1952,What are the key characteristics of each group,1,0,0,TRAIN
1953,• How can I group my documents into distinct categories,1,0,0,TRAIN
1954,If a business is looking to answer questions around the identification of anomalies or rare behavior and occurrences anomaly detection techniques are utilized to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior called outliers,4,5,1,TRAIN
1955,It has many applications in business from intrusion detection such as identifying strange patterns in network traffic to system health monitoring including spotting a malignant tumor in an MRI scan,11,2,1,TRAIN
1956,Some additional questions that can be answered using these techniques include • Given a massive database of financial data which transactions are suspicious and likely to be fraudulent,2,4,1,TRAIN
1957,• Given the huge number of container shipments arriving at a country’s ports every day which should be opened by customs to prevent smuggling terrorism etc,6,4,1,TRAIN
1958,• Given a log of all the traffic on a computer network which sessions represent attempted intrusions,4,2,1,TRAIN
1959,Association mining another set of techniques can help find correlations between different products or factors in an organization’s data,4,1,1,TRAIN
1960,For example if a customer purchases baby diapers he or she has a 60 percent chance of purchasing baby lotion within the next month,7,1,1,TRAIN
1961,By identifying such insights using association mining retailers can predict the need for new products and target customers with coupons and offers before the customer even realizes they are running out of baby lotion,5,5,1,TRAIN
1962,The most common application of association mining algorithms is in market basket analysis,5,1,1,TRAIN
1963,Unsupervised learning Clustering Anomaly detection Association mining Partition the data set into X groups so that records in the same group are similar to each other and records in different groups are dissimilar Identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicion by differing significantly from the majority of the data Find frequent patterns correlations and associations among a set of items in relational and transaction databases U ns up er vi se d le ar ni ng Clustering Anomaly detection Association mining Partition the data set into X groups so that records in the same group are similar to each other and records in different groups are dissimilar Identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicion by differing significantly from the majority of the data Find frequent patterns correlations and associations among a set of items in relational and transaction databases 13 14Demystifying data science Natural language processing NLP Natural language processing is a set of systematic processes for intelligently and efficiently analyzing understanding and deriving information from text data,19,7,1,TRAIN
1964,It can organize massive amounts of text data and perform numerous automated tasks such as automatic summarization machine translation named entity recognition relationship extraction sentiment analysis speech recognition and topic segmentation,12,2,1,TRAIN
1965,Key questions to ask and how to define high value use cases To identify meaningful and high value use cases for teams and organizations it is important to gather relevant information and requirements on three key pillars,5,1,1,TRAIN

2016,Making Content Services Smarter Using NLP WHITE PAPER MAKING CONTENT SERVICES SMARTER USING NLP Abstract There is an exponential growth in unstructured content due to digitization IoT regulatory compliance etc,4,1,1,TRAIN
2017,Because of this growth organizations are facing challenges on how to capture ingest and manage huge volume of unstructured content effectively in Content Services platform,5,2,1,TRAIN
2018,Traditional approaches are becoming ineffective,1,1,1,TRAIN
2019,Need of the hour is to address these challenges differently and bring some “intelligence” so that Content Services platforms can manage the unstructured content smartly,5,3,1,TRAIN
2020,This paper discusses how Natural Language Processing NLP can make a difference in Content Services by addressing challenges which are being faced,2,4,1,TRAIN
2021,Here we will first introduce NLP and then briefly describe how NLP can be used in Content Services while capturing ingesting and managing,5,2,1,TRAIN
2022,1 1 What is NLP Natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence dealing with the interactions between computers and human languages in particular on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data,5,3,1,TRAIN
2023,NLP includes text preprocessing sentence segmentation tokenization POS tagging Named Entity Recognition NER chunking parsing co reference resolution and text categorizer,8,3,1,TRAIN
2024,In this white paper we will focus on NER and categorizer,3,0,0,TRAIN
2025,1 1 1 Named Entity Recognition NER Named Entity Recognition is for identifying the entities in unstructured content,1,1,1,TRAIN
2026,Entities such as name person location time money are few of the common entities which can be extracted,5,1,1,TRAIN
2027,Apart from these models can be trained to extract business specific entities such as account number tax file number specific to the business,5,2,1,TRAIN
2028,Core capability of NER is classification and extraction of the named entities,3,1,1,TRAIN
2029,NER can extract static as well as dynamic entities,0,0,0,TRAIN
2030,1 1 2 Categorizer Core capability of categorizer is classification,3,0,0,TRAIN
2031,It helps in categorizing a chunk of unstructured text into predefined categories,2,2,1,TRAIN
2032,For example categorizer models can be used to categorize news articles into different genre sentiment analysis of messages identifying the custom document types for an organization etc,9,2,1,TRAIN
2033,using the predefined category phrases categorizer can best classify the content,4,1,1,TRAIN
2034,1 2 Terminology 1 2 1 Entity Entity is a singular identifiable and separate object,1,0,0,TRAIN
2035,For example name of a person organization city account number TFN number can be considered as an entity,6,2,1,TRAIN
2036,1 2 2 Entity Relationship The semantic relationship between two different entities are called as entity relationship,3,1,1,TRAIN
2037,For example relationship between a person name and an organization is “employed by”,5,1,1,TRAIN
2038,1 2 3 Annotation Annotation is a process in which the information of interest is tagged with an entity name,5,1,1,TRAIN
2039,For example John is tagged with the entity “person name”,3,1,1,TRAIN
2040,1 2 4 Labeled Content Labeled content is the content whose classification category and or entities are already known and which can serve as “training content” for training the AI models,5,2,1,TRAIN
2041,1 Natural Language Processing NLP External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited 2 1 Content Capture Capturing content in digital format is one of the first steps in Content Services,2,2,1,TRAIN
2042,Along with the content information such as customer name zip code type of the document is also captured,8,1,1,TRAIN
2043,Current capture process is based on the location of the information,4,1,1,TRAIN
2044,In this process templates are To implement the information extraction as a first step AI model needs to be trained,5,2,1,TRAIN
2045,NLP engines accepts annotated text files as training data set,1,2,1,TRAIN
2046,Once the information in text document or labeled content is annotated it can be used to train NLP engine,5,2,1,TRAIN
2047,More the number of annotated fed to capture tool and the tool is trained to extract information from a particular location for that template,6,2,1,TRAIN
2048,This location based information extraction is no longer productive due to huge variation in content layouts,5,1,1,TRAIN
2049,This issue can be solved by context based extraction,2,2,1,TRAIN
2050,Using NLP an AI model can files accommodating variations in the interested information more will be the accuracy of the AI model,3,2,1,TRAIN
2051,Once the AI model is trained it can be used to capture the information from new or unseen documents,3,2,1,TRAIN
2052,The new or unseen be trained which can then be used for extraction,1,1,1,TRAIN
2053,This process is also called as Cognitive Capture,2,1,1,TRAIN
2054,Extracted information then can be directly tagged to the content while saving into the Content Services or it can be used for verification during straight through processing etc,3,4,1,TRAIN
2055,documents may need to be OCRed if required,0,2,0,TRAIN
2056,Capture process implemented using NLP will not depend on layout of the content and still be able to capture appropriate information even if there is change in the layout as long as the information is in the same context,10,1,1,TRAIN
2057,2 How NLP Can Make Content Services Smarter External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited 2 1 1 Implementation Scenarios Below described are the some of the different implementation scenarios in the context of cognitive capture 2 1 1 1 Extracting metadata while Capture Captured information can be tagged to the content while saving into Content Services,6,5,1,TRAIN
2058,The tagged information will give identity to the content which helps in locating and reusing the content,4,2,1,TRAIN
2059,2 1 1 2 Data Verification for Straight through Processing Data captured can be verified with master As a first step the AI model is to be trained with labeled documents to retrieve metadata information from the document,6,3,1,TRAIN
2060,Since it is context based metadata identification both models NER as well as Categorizer can be used,2,2,1,TRAIN
2061,For training NER models the process is same that is to annotate the documents and then use the annotated documents for training,3,1,1,TRAIN
2062,Categorizer model is supported by some of the NLP tools such as Apache OpenNLP,1,1,1,TRAIN
2063,To train a categorizer model first the categories need to be defined,3,1,1,TRAIN
2064,For example to implement metadata identification through classification a category needs to be mapped to a metadata value,7,1,1,TRAIN
2065,As next step from labelled data management system for automatic processing such as claim processing etc,6,1,1,TRAIN
2066,2 2 Content Ingestion Content Ingestion is a process where content is loaded into Content Services platform either through a batch process or manually through a user interface,5,1,1,TRAIN
2067,Biggest challenge here is identifying the metadata to tag with,2,1,1,TRAIN
2068,For batch process metadata needs to be made available to the ingestion process through an XML CVS database etc,5,1,1,TRAIN
2069,For manual ingestion or upload user needs to think what metadata the file should have and then accordingly enter the metadata on user interface,4,1,1,TRAIN
2070,It content important business terms phrases which helps in classifying the content to the category need to be listed against that category,4,2,1,TRAIN
2071,This list of category mapped to business terms can be fed to NLP engine which then build a categorizer model,6,3,1,TRAIN
2072,Based on the occurrences of the business terms phrases in the new or unseen content it can be classified into a category which is being mapped to a metadata value,3,2,1,TRAIN
2073,New or unseen content is subjected to either NER or Categorizer or both the models,1,1,1,TRAIN
2074,Use of both models will need more time to train will give higher accuracy and of course less throughput,5,2,1,TRAIN
2075,With appropriate plug ins text from audio and video files can be generated and takes significant amount of time to finalize what metadata the content should have,7,2,1,TRAIN
2076,This manual process is also prone to mistakes,1,0,0,TRAIN
2077,NLP can help here by cognitively tagging the metadata to the content during ingestion,4,1,1,TRAIN
2078,NLP engine can be trained to identify the metadata to be tagged based on the context of the content,3,3,1,TRAIN
2079,The identified metadata can be tagged with the content during ingestion,1,2,1,TRAIN
2080,This can be illustrated by following diagram subjected to the AI models for metadata identification and then ingested into the Content Services Platform,2,4,1,TRAIN
2081,2 2 1 Implementations scenarios Described below are the different implementation scenarios in the context of cognitive content ingestion,3,1,1,TRAIN
2082,2 2 1 1 During Batch Ingestion In any batch ingestion process appropriate metadata values are needed to complete the process,4,1,1,TRAIN
2083,One of the major challenges is the non availability of the metadata values which are being expected by Content Service Platform,1,1,1,TRAIN
2084,NLP can help in bridging the expectation by extracting context based values,3,3,1,TRAIN
2085,AI models can be trained which can identify the metadata values as External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited a part of ingestion process and then load the content with appropriate metadata values,8,1,1,TRAIN
2086,With NLP tool as a part of ingestion pipeline content from sources where the metadata values are not available can be ingested into Content Services Platform,4,1,1,TRAIN
2087,2 2 1 2 Manual content upload When users upload content manually into Content Services Platform using a user interface they have to enter metadata values,5,1,1,TRAIN
2088,In order to do this users have to read through the document listen or view the content and then decide what metadata values this content can have,6,1,1,TRAIN
2089,From users’ perspective this process is very time consuming and prone to errors,1,2,1,TRAIN
2090,NLP can solve this challenge,2,0,0,TRAIN
2091,A trained NER or Categorizer model can identify what metadata values the content can have,4,0,0,TRAIN
2092,Users are first asked to upload content which can be analyzed by the AI model and the suggested metadata that can be prefilled on user interface,3,4,1,TRAIN
2093,Users need to just verify it and submit it,1,1,1,TRAIN
2094,This saves time for the user,2,0,0,TRAIN
2095,2 2 1 3 Shared Drive Migration Most of the organization store content on shared network drives,4,1,1,TRAIN
2096,Content which is stored on shared drive are not tagged with any metadata or organized in any directory structure,3,3,1,TRAIN
2097,Due to this the content cannot be located and reused,1,2,1,TRAIN
2098,More than that content laying on shared drive can be a risk on adherence to compliance and regulatory standards,5,1,1,TRAIN
2099,To overcome these challenges and to manage the content efficiently it needs to be migrated to a Content Service platform,2,2,1,TRAIN
2100,To migrate the content of shared drives a trained NER or Categorizer model can be plugged in into the migration framework,4,2,1,TRAIN
2101,NLP model can identify the metadata of content and it can be tagged to the content while loading the content into the content service platform,7,1,1,TRAIN
2102,2 3 Content Management Unstructured content stored on Content Services Platform needs to be managed effectively and efficiently in order to locate and reuse the content to enable the use of the content in business processes etc,6,2,1,TRAIN
2103,This can be achieved by maintaining the proper identity of content,2,1,1,TRAIN
2104,In Content Services Platform identity of a document is determined by the metadata values the content is tagged with,2,2,1,TRAIN
2105,Due to various compliance regulation such as GDPR identifying Personally Identifiable PI Information from the content is becoming a mandatory business function,5,2,1,TRAIN
2106,NLP based trained AI models can identify PI information from the content,2,3,1,TRAIN
2107,Going through huge content to understand the context the content is a daunting task,5,2,1,TRAIN
2108,It would be great for users if a summary of the content is available,1,0,0,TRAIN
2109,Following diagram illustrate three implementations which shows how NLP can add value while managing content,3,4,1,TRAIN
2110,External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited 2 3 1 Implementation scenarios Described below are implementation scenarios in the context of cognitive content management,3,2,1,TRAIN
2111,2 3 1 1 Maintaining Metadata Quality In Content Service Platform metadata values represent the identity of the content and using the metadata values the content will be located accessed and reused,3,4,1,TRAIN
2112,If a content is tagged with inaccurate values or some values are missing then either inaccurate content will be referred and reused or correct content will not be located,3,4,1,TRAIN
2113,Hence maintaining the quality of metadata or identity of content is extremely important,2,1,1,TRAIN
2114,NLP based trained AI models can help us in this,0,3,0,TRAIN
2115,It cannot only make sure that the content is tagged with corrected metadata but also tag the content with new metadata values or missing values,3,4,1,TRAIN
2116,Implementation steps for maintaining the metadata quality is similar to that of metadata identification but the post processing is different,5,1,1,TRAIN
2117,Process of maintaining metadata quality can run in background as batch process and make sure the metadata values are accurate,6,4,1,TRAIN
2118,2 3 1 2 Intelligent Summarization Content stored in Content Services Platform can be large,0,1,0,TRAIN
2119,It will be time consuming for users to go through the entire content and understand the content completely,4,2,1,TRAIN
2120,Legal contracts agreements etc,0,1,0,TRAIN
2121,falls in these category of content,1,0,0,TRAIN
2122,The challenge of large content can be addressed by NLP,2,1,1,TRAIN
2123,Using NLP an AI model can be trained which identifies important business terms in the content and then create the summary of the content using the sentences or paragraph around these important business terms,4,4,1,TRAIN
2124,The summarized document will be the new document and can be linked to the original content,2,2,1,TRAIN
2125,Once summary is created users can just go through the summary document to understand the complete content thereby saving lot of time,5,3,1,TRAIN
2126,Intelligent summarization process is suited for batch process as against to real time processing,5,1,1,TRAIN
2127,2 3 1 3 PII Identification Personally Identifiable Information belongs to an individual and there are regulations such as GDPR which mandates the protection of PI information,2,2,1,TRAIN
2128,If PII is not protected it might lead to data breach loss of customer trust and incur high penalty and legal issues,5,3,1,TRAIN
2129,Identifying PI information in unstructured content is a difficult and challenging task,3,3,1,TRAIN
2130,An NLP model can be trained which can identify PI information in a content,3,1,1,TRAIN
2131,Already trained models are available which helps in identifying standard PI information such as customer name zip code etc,6,1,1,TRAIN
2132,These AI models can be contextualized to identify PI information from a content,2,2,1,TRAIN
2133,Once content with PI information is identified it can be encrypted or the content with PI information can be attached stringent ACL or the content can be brought under retention or all of these can be done to ensure the content with PI information is properly protected,3,7,1,TRAIN
2134,2 3 2 More Implementation Scenarios There can be additional NLP implementation scenarios,1,0,0,TRAIN
2135,Analyzing the risk in contract or agreements is one such scenario,3,1,1,TRAIN
2136,NLP can be trained to identify risky terms or phrases and based on the occurrences of risky terms the contract or agreement can be classified as risky,2,4,1,TRAIN
2137,Classifying a content in a particular taxonomy is also one such implementation,2,1,1,TRAIN
2138,Each level of taxonomy can be identified with specific terms or contextual phrases,2,1,1,TRAIN
2139,An NLP model can be trained which will classify new or unseen content to a taxonomy term,2,1,1,TRAIN
2140,Similarly relevancy of a search result can be improved by query enrichment,4,1,1,TRAIN
2141,A search query before executing against a search engine can be analyzed,3,2,1,TRAIN
2142,Entities or context from the query can be identified and then the query can be enriched with additional selective criteria to get relevant search results,3,4,1,TRAIN
2143,There can be many other NLP implementations in Content Services Platforms,0,0,0,TRAIN
2144,Only few are discussed here,0,1,0,TRAIN
2145,External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited External Document © 2019 Infosys Limited This section discusses a high level process for implementing scenarios which are discussed above,4,3,1,TRAIN
2146,3 1 Getting Labeled Content To train AI model labeled content is required,3,3,1,TRAIN
2147,Most of the time labeled content is collected from production environment and because of this analyzing the content and building AI model from the content needs to be done in secured way,7,4,1,TRAIN
2148,Giving access only to few developers masking the content if possible are some of the ways to secure the labeled content,2,3,1,TRAIN
2149,3 2 Processing training data Labeled content needs to be processed before it can be used for training,2,3,1,TRAIN
2150,What processing is required depends on which AI model will be trained,2,3,1,TRAIN
2151,For training NER model an annotation tool is required,4,1,1,TRAIN
2152,There are annotation tools such as Brat tagtog prodigy etc using which the entities in the labeled content can be annotated and relationship between the different entities can be established,6,4,1,TRAIN
2153,Depending on the file format supported by the tool the labeled content needs to be converted into the different format,4,4,1,TRAIN
2154,For example an audio file needs to be converted into the text file using “speech to text” plug in and then it can be used for annotation by the annotation tool,8,3,1,TRAIN
2155,During the annotation entities are identified and tagged with an entity name,3,1,1,TRAIN
2156,For example an employee name can be identified and tagged to entity name “Person”,4,1,1,TRAIN
2157,For accurate results relationship between the entities can be established,1,1,1,TRAIN
2158,For example there are two entities employee name as “person” and a bank name as “organization” in one sentence,7,0,0,TRAIN
2159,One of the possible relationships between these entities can be “works at”,0,1,0,TRAIN
2160,Relationship helps in extracting the information accurately,1,1,1,TRAIN
2161,More the annotation of content more will the training and hence more will be accuracy,4,1,1,TRAIN
2162,For training categorizer model business terms phrases or sentences which helps in classifying the content in that category are identified,5,3,1,TRAIN
2163,Terms identified for different categories are listed in plain text file,1,2,1,TRAIN
2164,This file is then used for training the categorizer model,4,1,1,TRAIN
2165,If AI model need to be trained for more than one language then it is better to train language specific AI models,4,1,1,TRAIN
2166,3 3 Building AI models For training NER model once annotation of labeled content is done the files need to be converted into a machine readable format which NLP engine understand,6,4,1,TRAIN
2167,Most of the annotation tools offers APIs to convert the annotation format into the machine readable format,5,1,1,TRAIN
2168,Once converted these files are then fed to NLP engine which in turn internally build an AI model,3,2,1,TRAIN
2169,For training categorizer model the text file listing category mapped to business terms phrases or sentences is fed to NLP engine,7,4,1,TRAIN
2170,The NLP engine then internally build an AI model,2,0,0,TRAIN
2171,3 4 Testing AI Model From the labeled content a sub set can be used to test the accuracy of the trained AI model,3,3,1,TRAIN
2172,The content whose classification or entities to be extracted is already known and is subjected to the AI model,3,2,1,TRAIN
2173,If the AI model is able to correctly identify the category or extract the information the AI model is trained with sufficient accuracy and hence can be deployed for production use,6,3,1,TRAIN
2174,If the AI model does not perform adequately in this test run then the AI model need to be re trained with the additional labeled content,4,2,1,TRAIN
2175,3 5 Post Processor NLP engine with trained AL model can classify or extract the entities from new or unseen content,3,2,1,TRAIN
2176,To process the classification or extraction result of the NLP a post processer is required,6,1,1,TRAIN
2177,For example in case of metadata identification a categorizer model will give the list of metadata value with their probabilities,8,0,0,TRAIN
2178,Post processor should select the metadata value with highest probability,5,0,0,TRAIN
2179,Processing logic of Post processor depends on the implementation scenario,3,2,1,TRAIN
2180,3 6 Execution Once the AI model is trained and tested and post processor is developed the pipeline is ready to classify or extract the information from new or unseen documents,5,3,1,TRAIN
2181,The new content can be subjected to NER model or categorizer model or both depending upon the use case,5,2,1,TRAIN

2200,Deficiencies in Current Practices of Clinical Natural Language Processing CNLP White Paper “Virtually no CNLP software is fit for purpose out of the box and will invariably require tuning if not significant enhancement to serve a useful productive purpose to a high accuracy for a particular client ” Jon Patrick 2019 We have recently assessed the accuracy of Clinical NLP software available through either open source projects or commercial demonstration systems at processing pathology reports,10,4,1,TEST
2201,This whitepaper discusses the twenty eight deficiencies we observed in our testing of five different systems,0,2,0,TEST
2202,Our analysis is based on the need for industrial strength language engineering that must cope with a greater variety of real world problems than that experienced by research solutions,7,3,1,TEST
2203,In a research setting users can tailor their data and pre processing solutions to address the answer to a very specific investigation question unlike real world usage where there is little or no control over input data,9,1,1,TEST
2204,As a simple example in a language engineering application the data could be delivered in a standard messaging format say HL7 that has to be processed no matter what vagaries it embodies,6,4,1,TEST
2205,In a research project that data could be curated to overcome the uncertainties created by this delivery mechanism by removing the HL7 components before the CNLP processing was invoked a fix not available in a standard clinical setting,6,4,1,TEST
2206,When an organisation is intending to apply a CNLP system to their data the topics discussed in this document need to be assessed for their potential impact on their desired outcomes,5,5,1,TEST
2207,The evaluations were based on two key principles • There is a primary function to be performed by CNLP that is Clinical Entity Recognition CER,1,2,1,TEST
2208,• There is one secondary function and that is Relationship Identification,1,1,1,TEST
2209,Any other clinical NLP processing will rely on one or both of these primary functions,1,0,0,TEST
2210,For the purposes of this conversation we exclude “text mining” which uses a “bag of words” approach to language analysis and is woefully inadequate in a clinical setting,7,2,1,TEST
2211,Assessed Software • Amazon Concept Medical • Stanford NLP Metathesaurus • OPenNLP Metathesaurus • GATE Metathesaurus • cTAKES The systems have the listed deficiencies to a greater or lesser extent,4,2,1,TEST
2212,No system has all these problems,1,0,0,TEST
2213,The deficiencies discussed are compiled across the 5 systems under the following headings • Deficiencies in Understanding Document Structure • Deficiencies in Tokenisation • Deficiencies in Grammatical Understanding • Deficiencies in the CER Algorithms • Deficiencies in Semantics and Interpreting Medical Terminology Deficiencies in Understanding Document Structure Missing Contextual Recognition The first task for any system is to recognise the context of the text,4,4,1,TEST
2214,This requires identifying the class of information in the document as a whole although sometimes it is only manifest through the structure of the document Inability to Recognise Headings,4,1,1,TEST
2215,Headings can be presented in a report by visual layout of uppercase or title case orthography and surrounding whitespace,4,2,1,TEST
2216,However they can also be provided by lables from a HL7 tagset,1,1,1,TEST
2217,Headings provide key information on the shift in the type of content to be expected and therefore warrant a different processing objective that is key information components that represent major topic shifts,7,3,1,TEST
2218,These are classically defined by section headers but not always,1,1,1,TEST
2219,Recognising headerless topic shifts is crucial to high accuracy results,3,1,1,TEST
2220,Failure to recognise headings will lead to identification of incorrect entity values or inhibit corroboration of correct entity identification e g identifying the full specimen description under examination might only be achieved by comparing content in the Final Diagnosis and the Nature of Specimen sections of a pathology report,10,5,1,TEST
2221,One system had difficulty recognising headings that where concatenations of words embedded with full stops e g Pathology Report Section due to their tokenizers behaviour,2,3,1,TEST
2222,As headings are important both for section boundary detection and context setting this Deficiency threatens a great deal of later processing,5,2,1,TEST
2223,Inability to properly recognise specimen boundaries,0,1,0,TEST
2224,Separating specimens in a multi specimen report is critical to correct interpretation of the disease location,4,1,1,TEST
2225,In some types of reports many specimens may be described with only some containing disease so incorrect identification of the boundary of the specimen description will result in the wrong specimen being assigned the identified disease,5,2,1,TEST
2226,Deficiencies in Tokenisation Weaknesses in tokenisation Tokens can be crudely defined as the strings between whitespace and they take many forms,1,4,1,TEST
2227,A large range of non alphabetic keyboard characters can be used for different purposes and in clinical texts the slash “ ” has many functions,2,2,1,TEST
2228,It can used to express a ratio but also to signify time duration date a proportion of lymph nodes involved in a malignant tumour etc,8,2,1,TEST
2229,Two tokenisers keep the tokens on each side of the slash together while another separated them so that each was correct some of the time and incorrect at other times,2,2,1,TEST
2230,This problem needs stronger context identification to produce the correct analysis at a consistently high accuracy level,5,2,1,TEST
2231,Deficiency to recognise alphanumeric entities Many entities are described with a combination of characters and digits especially biochemical names,2,1,1,TEST
2232,These can be written with and without hyphens e g HER2 and HER 2,0,1,0,TEST
2233,It is not uncommon to see the numeric component treated incorrectly as the value of the entity in question instead of being part of its name,7,1,1,TEST
2234,Inability to exclude bullet point markers from any named entity It is common to present content as a series of bullet points to make for easier reading,5,3,1,TEST
2235,The bullet identifier can be of many different forms including digits Roman digits in upper and lower case dots and hyphens,2,3,1,TEST
2236,Incorrect tokenisation has incorporated this information into a clinical entity so that subsequently the entity could not be correctly semantically identified,4,2,1,TEST
2237,Faulty Newline tokenising We notice that different tokenisers use different ways to deal with the newline symbol ‘ n’,2,3,1,TEST
2238,Three tokenisers do not split the input string by the newline symbol ‘ n’,1,2,1,TEST
2239,Two Tokenisers separate the tokens by backslash ‘ ’ and merge n into the next word,2,1,1,TEST
2240,The third tokeniser keeps the whole newline symbol ‘ n’ together as a whole token concatenated with the next word,3,2,1,TEST
2241,Faulty Interpretation of ‘ ’ One tokeniser for a reason we don’t entirely understand changed a ‘ ’ to a ‘ ’,2,1,1,TEST
2242,While their subsequent processing seemed to cope with this shift we found that all our annotations were made incorrect as to their position due to the introduction of new characters,4,3,1,TEST
2243,Faulty Special Symbol Tokenising One of the tokenisers did not recognise these symbols ‘ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ and treated them together with the neighbouring words giving faulty outcomes,2,3,1,TEST
2244,Problematic Interpretation of the Hyphen ‘ ‘ The use of the hyphen is ambiguous for CNLP,3,0,0,TEST
2245,It can used to join two concepts together and to separate two discrete concepts from each other,1,2,1,TEST
2246,Our policy is to separate lexical elements either side of a hyphen and interpret each individually,4,0,0,TEST
2247,However the three examined tokenisers do not split by hyphen and treat the whole combination as one single token,2,2,1,TEST
2248,This is bad practice,1,0,0,TEST
2249,Faulty Alphanumeric String Processing Alphanumeric strings should usually be kept intact for clinical processing as they most often represent a unit record identifier of some sort,5,1,1,TEST
2250,One tokeniser split the string at character type boundaries resulting in false identification,3,2,1,TEST
2251,Faulty tokenisation of real valued numbers One tokeniser would split real numbers on the decimal point so as to create 3 tokens,4,3,1,TEST
2252,This destroys the value of any decimal numeric values attached to attributes for example,2,1,1,TEST
2253,Deficiencies in Grammatical Understanding Missing Acronym Association with Expanded Name • Lack of association of acronyms with their full names,1,2,1,TEST
2254,Clinical reports are replete with acronyms and their accurate interpretation is important,2,0,0,TEST
2255,Where they are presented along with their expanded name the two should be correctly attached to each whereas we have observed them being treated as separate entity references,2,4,1,TEST
2256,Context inconsistencies • A weakness at identifying the same content in different contexts,2,1,1,TEST
2257,Some systems are inconsistent in that they will identify a given entity correctly in one context but fail to identify the same entity in a different context,4,2,1,TEST
2258,This is particularly surprising and indicates a lack of generalisation in their entity recognition function,4,1,1,TEST
2259,Inability to recognise the same entity with the same words expressed in a different word order,3,2,1,TEST
2260,A critical aspect of entity recognition is being able to recognise the same content with variable word order e g “high grade serous carcinoma” versus “Serous high grade carcinoma”,11,0,0,TEST
2261,Simple CER methods that use rule based approaches will have a serious difficulty with this common problem,3,2,1,TEST
2262,Statistical machine learning methods are required to circumvent this by treating it as a generalised problem,3,3,1,TEST
2263,Failure to recognise Morphology of words • We have observed an inability to identify entities when the same word is rendered in a different lexical morphology,6,2,1,TEST
2264,Many words have the same general meaning but change form when used in different grammatical roles e g “malignant” and “malignancy”,4,2,1,TEST
2265,However at times the different morphology can also carry different meanings which often needs to be discriminated so “malignant cells” is a description of a behaviour whereas “malignancy” is a statement of a disorder,6,2,1,TEST
2266,Incomplete Negation Recognition • Negation in clinical texts is of vital importance but is also complicated because of its four way between the semantics of negative meaning and the grammar of negation representation such as normal abnormal not normal not abnormal,6,1,1,TEST
2267,While some systems do recognise grammatical negation many do not control for the positive negative aspect of the semantics of individual medical lexical items,3,1,1,TEST
2268,This failure can lead to either false positives or false negatives in the processed outcome,3,1,1,TEST
2269,Part of Speech POS Identification Invalid Two common mis categorisations of POS is the assignment of nouns as adjectives and incorrect identification of Proper Nouns,2,1,1,TEST
2270,Erroneous Sentence boundary Detection • Sentence Boundary detection was often faulty due to the tokenising of the newline character,2,1,1,TEST
2271,When the “n character was concatenated with the following word often section names would become unidentifiable e g “nDiagnosis”,7,2,1,TEST
2272,We regard this as a major failure because of the cascading effect in correctly processing the document,4,2,1,TEST
2273,Deficiencies in the CER Algorithms Inconsistent Relationship linking • Identifying relationships between entities to a high accuracy is very difficult and still very much a research topic,3,1,1,TEST
2274,Systems that do identify relationships need to be very careful but at least should be consistent in its pairings which from our observations commonly they are not,0,2,0,TEST
2275,Mistakes in Graphical Representation of Relationships • Drawing lines to connect related entities and labeling graphically is helpful in interpreting the computational constructions but they need to connect the correct entities and not create false relationships,1,4,1,TEST
2276,The danger here is that a visually appealing graphical representation carries a lot of weight and errors are therefore easily accepted,3,4,1,TEST
2277,Intrusive Newlines • Interference in recognising the correct extent of an entity can be due to newline characters,3,1,1,TEST
2278,Entity recognition can be seriously imperiled by newline characters distributed throughout the text as is very commonplace in pathology reports,3,2,1,TEST
2279,It is important to use a pre processor cleaning mechanisms to remove these extraneous characters so that an entity is properly recognised even if a non printable character is buried within its extent,4,4,1,TEST
2280,Deficiencies in Semantics and Understanding Medical Terminology Unawareness of Anatomical Hierarchy • Unawareness of conventional anatomical hierarchy,1,0,0,TEST
2281,Some processing shows a lack of awareness of the general anatomical hierarchy e g cell components mislabeled as anatomical class,4,2,1,TEST
2282,• Poor utilisation of body structure ontology,4,0,0,TEST
2283,Lack of a comprehensive medical vocabulary,1,0,0,TEST
2284,• Common medical words that should readily match to a known name go unrecognised e g oophorectomy,3,2,1,TEST
2285,Non discrimination of Meta information • Lack of discrimination between meta information and patient specific information,4,0,0,TEST
2286,Pathology reports always contain general information from the body of knowledge of the discipline and specific content describing the patient’s disease state e g descriptions of the criteria for selecting various values for a grade value are not the grade of the sample examined,9,5,1,TEST
